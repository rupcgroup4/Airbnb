Very neat and spacious and the lovely balcony & roof terrace are a definite bonus!<br/>I didn't meet Aafje in person as she was on a trip but it was really simple to communicate with her through email and sms, she's very easy going en helpful. Klaas, the upstairs neighbor, was also very accommodating in Aafje's absence.<br/>This was my first experience with Airbnb and I loved it!<br/>I definitely recommend staying at this apartment!"

5,1917340,8/7/2012,Wolfgang,"Die Wohnung hat einesehr angenehme AtmosphÃ?re, traf unseren Geschmack.Sie liegt ruhig, aber so zentral, dass wir keine FahrrÃ?der mieten mussten, sondern zu FuÃü Ã?berall hinkamen.Restaurants und EinkaufsmÃ¶glichkeiten gibts auch in unmittelbarer NÃ?he. -Der schriftliche Kontakt mit Aafje war sehr nett, wir bekamen viele gut Tips, auch die Nachbarn zeigten sich freundlich und hilfsbereit.<br/>Die Versorgung des Katers war kein Problem."
5,5254117,6/20/2013,Sarah,I decided to extend my stay in Amsterdam last minute and Aafje was kind enough to accommodate me that afternoon on very short notice for two nights. Her apartment is beautiful and spacious and just a block or so away from Vondelpark. The neighborhood was very nice  safe. Checking in and out were easy and very flexible. I would happily stay in this flat if I find myself in Amsterdam once again.
5,5303672,6/23/2013,Zhanna,"Everything was perfect! The apartment is superb, so is the location. You also get to know the wonderful cat Muis :) Best choice!"
5,8429239,10/30/2013,Mariell,"My friend and I had a lovely long weekend at Aafje's place, we didn't meet Aafje because she was on holiday but her neigbor let us in and was very helpful. The apartment is really perfect, big and clean and bright. It's right around the corner from both a grocery store and the tram. We also had lunch at Forno on the corner which was one of our best meals in Amsterdam.<br/><br/>A couple of things i wish were better was towels (we only found three towels laid out for us), a hair dryer and maybe another duvet. <br/><br/>We thought it was a lot of fun living with a cat, although I was worried about his health after he peed on my clothes. I'm not too squeamish about these things, but I know a lot of other people would be. While we were there he peed inside at least three times and I hope he wasn't stressed because of us. He really was a very sweet and cuddly cat. <br/><br/>But all in all it was really great, I would definitely book this apartment again."
5,65787945,3/17/2016,Hugh,"The apartment was very welcoming and Aafje was very responsive. The apartment is spacious and delightful and within easy biking or public transportation to all Amsterdam sites. Grocery, restaurants, and bars are only a few minutes walk. The building has a lovely rooftop terrace for warm weather, and the surrounds were quiet. This was our first experience with an AirBnB, and we couldn't have enjoyed our stay more!"
5,82710261,6/29/2016,Arnaud,"Eva heeft een zeer leuk, ruim en verlicht appartement met 2 terrasjes! De buurt is rustig en toch dichtbij een tramhalte om je te verplaatsen naar het centrum. Als je naar Amsterdam gaat is dit zeker een goede plaats om te verblijven. Eerst waren er wat complicaties omdat wij onze trip naar Amsterdam al geboekt hadden en Eva er helaas die dag niet kon zijn om ons binnen te laten. Ze heeft een goede oplossing gevonden door haar vriendin de deur te laten open doen voor ons, zij was ook perfect op tijd !"
5,86392622,7/16/2016,James,"The listing was exactly as described. The furnishings are basic but completely functional. The apartment is bright and airy, and the kitchen has everything you need. The amount of space was quite nice and more than enough for one or two persons. The two balconies and rooftop were wonderful bonuses, and Caroline and Klass, Eva's friends who greeted me for her, were very responsive and gracious. My flight was delated repeatedly, and they made sure they were available. I would definitely stay here again."
5,133032903,2/20/2017,Serafine,"We stayed at Eva's for a Long Weekend and really enjoyed her place. It is very homy and we felt welcomed. Also we came really late and the Check-In was so easy and no Problem at all, the whole communication with Eva was really easy and nice.<br/>We liked the neighborhood a lot, it's easy too reach the inner City and there are a few nice Restaurants and bars just around the Corner.<br/>I would definitely recommend Evas place. "
5,134069917,2/26/2017,Linda,"Eva's place was exactly as depicted in her pictures and her description. It is in a residential area which is awesome if you want to meet the locals and hang out where the locals hang out. The tram (train) is right around the corner and takes you directly to the city centre, but if you are up for a walk it is only a 15 minute walk. This apartment was clean and beautiful and Eva was super accommodating. 5/5 stars! Definitely recommend staying here!"

5,173000511,7/22/2017,MÃ¡rton,"We had a great time at the apartment. Aafje our host was helpful and the flat is excellent. 1 min away from the tram, close to supermarket and other stuff. The house is spacious and cozy, amazing for couples. Totally recommend it for everyone to stay there :)"

5,295745665,7/24/2018,Annalisa,"We stayed in Aafje apartment for 3 nights. She's been very kind so I could check in when it was most convenient for me. The apartment was bigger than I expected from the pictures and very comfortable, in a nice yet quiet location. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
5,299950148,8/1/2018,Rebecca,"Had the best stay ever in Amsterdam this year- the location is perfect. The apartment is lovely... if you want to stay in an authentic Amsterdam style apartment itâÄôs the right place to be. Beautiful place, relaxed area but with plenty of buzz when it comes to restaurants and bars nearby. The neighbours were so lovely too. CouldnâÄôt fault it. Hope to return again next time.<br/><br/>Thanks again Aafje!"
5,301361784,8/4/2018,Anne,A beutiful place in a quite neighborhood. Close to everything. We really enjoyed the stay.
5,337417345,10/16/2018,Doris,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Aafje's apartment, which was incredibly ""homey"", and in an excellent locationâÄîvery close to local cafes, restaurants and public transportâÄîwith plenty of space inside!<br/><br/>One particular item worth consideringâÄîand this is more than likely an Amsterdam/Netherlands expectation; rather than something unique to this apartment blockâÄîis the long, steep and narrow staircase(s).Â Â We travelled with heavy luggage which required both of us to navigate the staircase to and from the third floor.<br/><br/>Aafje's communication was excellent and responsive, and was an helpful resource for discovering local knowledge.<br/><br/>We would stay again if available during any subsequent visits to Amsterdam."
5,348522702,11/14/2018,Noa,Avery nice apartment and good location!
74,1319319,5/21/2012,Thomas,"The apartment was quiet, clean and has a great view on a river. It is also  close to the city centre (15 min walk or 2 stations by tram). We had a great stay in Amsterdam. Thank you for your hospitality, Stephan! "
74,1364686,5/28/2012,Johannes,"The stay in Stephan's apartment was our first experience with airbnb. So we are really thankful for his confidence. Stephan was flexible and a very friendly helpful host. Even at 6:30 in the morning he answered on our messages for an earlier check-in.  <br/>The apartment was absolut amazing and in perfect condition. The view out of the window is the highlight. It's better than a TV. ;)<br/>The location is perfect for renting a bike. You only need 10-15min to the centrum. <br/>I would definitely recommend this place. Thanks for the great stay.<br/>"
74,1508984,6/18/2012,Luci,Stephan's apartment was beautiful. The view out the main window is a great way to wake up in the morning and finish the day in the evening. It is very close to transportation that takes you anywhere you need to go.  There is a supermarket nearby to buy what ever you need.  I highly recommend Stephan and his apartment.  He was a gracious host and very helpful with information about Amsterdam.
74,1583082,6/28/2012,Pavel,"It was a fantastic experience staying in this wonderful apartment.<br/>Stephan was a great host, really friendly and welcoming! He was extremely gracious and helpful. He gave us a lot of useful info on Amsterdam as well as he prepared a brochure of recommendations for us with the best places to visit/eat and entertaiment that alighed perfectly with our interests.<br/>His apartment was beautiful, modern, clean and cosy with everything that we possibly could have needed. There is a wonderful view on the nice canal with ducks and swans. Location is excellent for quality sleep as well. Definitely will be coming back to stay here again if we ever go back to Amsterdam. I highly recommend staying in this apartment. Thanks Stephan! "
74,1710574,7/15/2012,Tim,"Very nice, bright, clean, quiet, well-kept apartment in a good location. Easy tram access to anywhere in the city, short walk to grocery stores. Perfect for two, fine for three. A little tight but manageable for the four of us. Underground parking is convenient."
74,1862380,8/1/2012,Marcel,"Our stay at Stephan's place was great. He's an excellent host, and a really nice and good-hearted guy. Communication was fast and pleasant, with great flexibility regarding check- in and -out, and everything went absolutely smooth. The apartment is very nice, clean and convenient, with a good and positive vibe to it. It is very bright, with a great view outside and very quiet. The location in Amsterdam Oost is fantastic. Very close to the center, by walk, public transportation and bike. And Oost, with the redeveloped harbour, all it's architecture, parks, cafes and restaurants and the close-by Ijburg is a real treat, and in our experience way better and more fun then the center. And Stephan's place is the perfect spot for it to stay at. We can wholeheartedly recommend it, and like to stay there again for our next trip to Amsterdam."
74,2222483,9/7/2012,Boris,"Sehr netter und unkomplizierer Empfang. SchÃ¶ne, saubere Wohnung, sehr gut Anbindung an Nahverkehr (Linie 26, 3 Stationen bis Innenstadt), sehr sonnige Wohnung, schÃ¶nes Bad.<br/>Ideal fÃ?r 3 Personen."
74,2262136,9/11/2012,Natalie,"I booked a 2 night stay in Amsterdam as a surprise birthday present for my boyfriend. This was my first time using air bnb and i came across Stephan's apartment. Stephan was great when i enquired, answering all my emails quickly and i knew this apartment would make an amazing surprise. The apartment did not disappoint, the views were breathtaking and Stephan was very welcoming and accomadating, he even fulfilled a request of flowers and champagne made by boyfriend a couple of days before our stay. The apartment was 2 stops on the tram from the centre and in a great area. We loved it here and would most definately return and reccommend Stephan's apartment to friends and family!"

74,2557293,10/9/2012,Erin,"Stephan was a gracious and accommodating host from beginning to end.  And what a great apartment!!!  My two friends and I, weary from a long drive from Berlin that day, felt so welcomed as soon as we were greeted by Stephan.  He showed us everything we needed to know around the apartment and truly made us feel like his home was now our home.  He offered advice on transportation, recommendations for the area, and said to contact him at any time during our stay, if needed.<br/>We felt relaxed and comfortable here - hooked up our i-pod to the stereo, sipped tea, and enjoyed the beautiful view from the couch.  Even the cushy carpet was comfortable to lounge on.  Not to mention the rain shower... what a treat!<br/><br/>Stephan and his home are A+++.  <br/><br/>Thanks a million!<br/>"
74,2661183,10/20/2012,Andrea,"Hello Stephan your house is very beautiful, full of every comfort and useful accessories. I remained hours watching the rain from the view it offers your home in a very relaxing atmosphere. You have been very kind and helpful, I regret not having been able to talk to you in real time with you because of my English too narrow. the holiday despite the bad weather was ok.<br/>thank you again!"
74,2736211,10/28/2012,Claire,"We had an absolutely amazing time at Stephan's place. He was such a welcoming host, giving us tips on things to do and making us feel completely at home as soon as we arrived.<br/><br/>The apartment is stunning - the view across the canal is pure Amsterdam, while being away from the hustle and bustle of the centre. It was so easy to get around (luckily for us, as my sense of direction is awful) - just 3 tram stops from the centre, and Zeeburg has all you could need too. <br/><br/>We loved it so much we found it hard to leave the flat every morning - one of our favourite memories of our trip will be sitting on that sofa, watching the geese waddle past the window. <br/><br/>We totally recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit Amsterdam... book it! Now!"
74,2845477,11/9/2012,Daria,"I don't want to write too much, bcz otherwise people will start to rent this place more and next time we may miss it.. But let's be honest !.<br/>We are very happy with our choice, the place looks the same like on the photos, even better. View is just amazing, there is a big channel with swans, geese and ducks. The location nd apartment itself are peaceful and quiet, design is modern, but very cosy. Together with  alive plant make you feel like in Oasis... <br/>Everything was just great, thank you, Stephan, for this opportunity!"
74,2861970,11/12/2012,Aneliya,"Stephan's apartment has great atmosphere and is really cosy - it is just like in the description, if not even better. The location is very convenient to go around Amsterdam. Overall, great value and very friendly attitude - highly recommend this place."

74,3400120,1/23/2013,Brad,"I came to Amsterdam to research at the International Institute for Social History, and Stephan's apartment was a short block away. The pictures do the apartment justice - what am amazing view,  and what a comfortable place to wake up in the morning and come back to in the evening.  I was able to cook and save money, though there are plenty of restaurants in the area, and Stephan was very helpful and accommodating. If I come back to Amsterdam I'll definitely stay here!"
74,4264716,4/23/2013,Konstantin,"We with my wife and daughter spent several days in the apartment of Stephen, and it was an amazing time. I was in Amsterdam many times, but the first, during our stay in Amsterdam we had a feeling that we live outside the city. A delightful view of the pond, geese, regularly come on right under our window, herons, walking by the pond, seagulls - all this gives a sense of calm and a confident harmony. The apartment was absolutely everything you need for a comfortable stay, but most importantly - it was a pleasure to meet such a man as Stephen. Thank you very much for this time! I hope we will be back "

The apartment is easy to be reached by Amsterdam Centraal Station by tram and Stephan is a kind and accomodating host. We had a huge delay with our flight and he has always been in touch with us and available to greet us when we finally got there.

His home is like you could see at the pictures: beautifully decorated, comfortable, very quiet, equipped with everything you need and lovely views to a waterway where geese and other birds are around all day. <br/>We repeat if we will travel to Amsterdam again because the location is perfect, not so far from the city center allows you to experience Amsterdam far away the crowded streets and turistic routes. <br/>"
74,60711515,1/26/2016,Nil,"We had a great time in Amsterdam, is a nice city. Stephan's appartment is very clean and modern, with a nice Living room where if you get sunny days the ilumination is perfect, and the views to the cannel too. The appartment is 10 min from the center by bike, is near. "
74,61937665,2/9/2016,Manuela,"Es war wirklich ein schÃ¶nes Wochenende in Amsterdam - die Wohnung ist super - der Ausblick, vor allem bei Sonne, echt toll - und Stephan ist ein toller Gastgeber! Die Lage ist auch perfekt, alles ist gut zu erreichen - zu FuÃü und mit Bus und Bahn - Stephan hat uns an der Haltestelle abgeholt und uns ein paar gute Tipps gegeben! Es war alles da, was man so braucht (HandtÃ?cher, BettwÃ?sche, FÃ¶hn etc) und fÃ?r drei Leute auf jeden Fall genug Platz (Couch und Bett auch sehr gemÃ?tlich). Bei An- und Abreise war Stephan sehr flexibel. Danke, wir hatten eine schÃ¶ne Zeit!"
74,62898861,2/18/2016,Jamie,"Upon arrival stephan greeted us and discussed what was expected during our stay,he was warm and welcoming giving us plenty of advice and local insider information. The apartment was everything we expected and more with wide expansive views from the living room window which can let sunlight shine though ought the room all day. Vey clean and homely plus a great easily accessible location."

74,66386711,3/22/2016,Laurence,Stephan est super chaleureux. Il nous attendait Ã  la station de tramway. Il nous a mis trÃ¨s Ã  l'aise. Un accueil vraiment exceptionnel ! Et son appartement est magnifique et Ã  seulement 3 stations du centre ville. 
74,70578471,4/18/2016,Burton,"I have been using Airbnb many times throughout my years of traveling throughout Europe, and Stephan's apartment is definitely on my top 5 list! As the photos indicate, the main living room is magnificent facing a large pond with geese, and most importantly the apartment is ""dead quiet"". So getting a deep night's uninterrupted sleep is a guarantee. Most importantly, Stephan is a sweet, friendly and gracious man! I spent a wonderful nine days and nights here! "
74,74642260,5/16/2016,Sandra,"The apartment is as pictured, even better.  ItâÄôs great to be on a canal where you can watch people, dogs, birds and boats.<br/><br/>Stephan, our host, is obviously an experienced AirBnB host.  The booklet we received prior to our visit to Amsterdam and to his apartment made our arrival process straightforward and simple.  Stephan, a charming man, greeted us upon our arrival, showed us the ins and outs of the apartment, readily answered our questions and then left us to enjoy the delightful experience of having the outside environment as part of our living environment.<br/><br/>The living room, dining area and kitchen are all one open room facing floor to ceiling windows.  The sofa comfortable, the kitchen well equipped, in fact, one of the best equipped kitchens we have had the pleasure to use.  Even the knives are sharp!<br/><br/>The bathroom is huge.  You could spend hours in the shower, if you werenâÄôt busy watching the life on the canal.  The bedroom was entirely satisfactory for our needs.<br/><br/>It was great being in an area that has gone through the urban revival experience.  We enjoyed watching the children being taken to school by their parents in the morning, shopping at the charming Italian âÄúdeliâÄù on one of the nearby shopping streets and easily acquiring our groceries at the local AH.<br/><br/>The train going to Central Station and surface tram to the museum area are both a 5 minute walk from the apartment and run frequently.<br/><br/>We would definitely stay in this apartment again and would highly recommend it to friends.<br/><br/>P.S. If you enjoy watching birds you are in for a treat.  We saw Egyptian geese and rose-ringed parakeets."
74,92517545,8/8/2016,Isabel,"Stephan es una persona muy atenta y amigable, de fÃ¡cil atenciÃ?n gentil y dispuesto a ayudar, nos consiguiÃ? estacionamiento en mismo edificio a un precio razonable, nos saliÃ? a buscar a la calle, pues no encontrÃ¡bamos el nÃºmero, serÃ?a bueno pusiera mÃ¡s destacado este.<br/>El Dpto es muy lindo, con una hermosa vista, tiene muy acogedor el lugar, solo renovar ropas cama y toallas serÃ?a perfecto y lugar WC mejorar ventilaciÃ?n.

91,1677162,7/10/2012,Jeanette,"<br/>We stayed two nights at Raymonds place and enjoyed our stay! <br/>His house is near to Vondelpark and a tram station to the city center is only a few minutes away. The room is a very simple one, with a comfortable bed, a chair and and a little desk. It is on the first floor with a view to the canal in front of the house.  <br/>Raymond is a very good host, who makes you always feel comfortable. <br/>But be careful, his little cat loves bags and suitcases ;-)"
91,1699731,7/13/2012,Philippe,"Raymond was a really good host. I've been welcomed very warmly into his home. He made sure I had everything I needed. His place is just a couple of minutes walking from the tram, so it's definitely easy accessible. He was gladly to help when asked for some tips on what to visit in Amsterdam. The room is simple, but definitely all that I'd wish for. I can recommend it to anyone who is visiting Amsterdam."
91,1820584,7/28/2012,Tony,"Wonderful location on the ""other end"" of Vondelpark. the place was perfect for us. clean and charming and the bedroom was perfectly comfortable. I will gladly return upon my next visit. Mia the cat is a sweetheart with a lot of character as well"
91,1851198,7/31/2012,Nigel,"really good value for money, the room is basic, but clean and comfortable. It's easily reach via No.2 tram and in a very pleasant part of the city....................I've never seen a canal with such a view, I loved sitting on a bench at night, looking at the villas opposite."
91,2017129,8/18/2012,Zack,"Room and facilities exactly as described. Raymond was very welcoming and friendly. We'd been to Amsterdam before and had things in mind to do, but Raymond was still helpful in directing us and telling us about the local area. Thouroughly recommended, would definitely stay again."

91,2143081,8/30/2012,Ilya,"We spent  9 days at Raymond's. He is a great host, friendly and happy. We had everything we needed. Location is very beautiful and it is easy  to get in any place by tram. It is close to the Vondelpark, a great place for running and sports, if one needs it. If we in Amsterdam again, will be happy to stay here."
91,2215602,9/6/2012,Eva,"Enjoyed staying there a lot! Quite area, but still close enough to the centre. Public transfer within a 3 minute walk - as well as a little bakery with very lecker croissants :-)  Perfectly located and a nice leaned back host! So - everything fine! <br/>"
91,2247660,9/10/2012,Karolina,Raymond is very cool host. He is very helpful providing every information needed and showing the dutch stzle of living. highlz recommendable
91,2286862,9/14/2012,Denise,"Raymonds place is exactly as described - simple, comfortable & convenient. Raymond is a welcoming and really interesting host. He really makes you feel like his home is also yours and hopefully you'll get to spend a bit of time chatting to him about all the interesting things he's doing. "
91,2343787,9/19/2012,Mikhail,"I've spent 7 nights at Raymond. He is such a person - when you don't need him he is never on you way but when you do - he always ready for you - was really cool staying in his apartment. <br/>Regarding the place itself. Public transport in 3 minutes walk, big and beautiful park in 7, big supermarket also around 7 minutes. Other than that - a rather big bed, a table and chair in the room. Kitchen with all needed stuff, bathroom, washing machine, wi-fi. I had everything one could imagine.<br/>Definitely recommended place"
91,2400255,9/24/2012,Austin,"House was close to airport train, and close to tram going into downtown."
91,2536694,10/8/2012,Atsushi,"Raymond,he has a super cuuuute black cat.<br/>Located on the river of westlandgracht and close to Vondel park.<br/>I was a pleasant stay.<br/>Because he was so busy,I couldn't talk much.<br/>but he is a nice guy."
91,2631636,10/16/2012,Faith,"Since we were in Amsterdam for just 1 night, Raymond's extra room was sufficient for our purposes. It's a good thing he's a night owl since we checked in a bit late. We're very thankful that he accepted our booking since we're 4 adults -- and he was upfront that the room would be a tight squeeze for us, but we managed to sleep well and soundly. Location-wise, it's not that central, particularly if you just want to walk to places of interest. But if riding the tram isn't a problem, you'd enjoy staying at Raymond's (especially with the pretty lake across his apartment). One word of advice -- don't let the cat slip out of the door! She's a character, that one. :) "
91,2677207,10/21/2012,Veronika,"Raymond is an awesome guy, we had  and very good time at his place. He is uncomplicated, welcoming and also helped us to find another place where we could stay after. The apartment is very much what the pictures tell so if you don't need much comfort and just wanna have an easy stay you're right. And he really knows about what is going on in Amsterdam! <br/>"
91,2704770,10/24/2012,Filip,"great location,tram/line 2 is only a 3min walk away and goes directly to the city centre.<br/>Raymond is helpfull and friendly! Nevertheless my girlfriend and i were really dissapointed about the room. It is exactly as on the picture except that the room was really dirty especially the ground and the walls. Bed was ok and sheets were clean. Raymond, just give the walls a quick paint and clean the floor(i takes 5min)before guests arrive. Bathroom was ok but again we encountered a dirty kitchen...! A smell of the housecat (lovely by the way)is also all over the house.<br/>We wanted to stay 2 nights but left after the 1st. Sorry Raymond but i had to write this so the next guests will hopefully profit..."
91,2803285,11/4/2012,Lisette,"Locatie van deze kamer is prima! met OV of fiets is het centrum van Amsterdam prima bereikbaar. Simpele kamer zoals ook wordt aangegeven in de omschrijving maar wel met een heel mooi uitzicht over het water! De gastheer helaas niet ontmoet maar verzorging was goed geregeld, handdoeken lagen klaar en we hadden een eigen sleutel van de woning. Een aanrader als je niet op zoek bent naar luxe maar gewoon voor een nacht of aantal nachten een bed nodig hebt tijdens een verblijf in Amsterdam."
91,2848271,11/10/2012,Andrea,Very nice and uncomplicated!

91,2873589,11/12/2012,Sumeet,"Although I booked Raymond spot last minute it was the greatest decision I made last-minute just because it was near the airport I had a broken hand and this place was within walking distance from the train.Ramen and his friends are just nice people very very laid-back and chill and so if you're looking for people that actually no answer them have good tips that are laid-back and go on with their own business then you also kind of feel part of the of this culture I would definitely highly recommend this place! it is located near the water very much near everything you need to be near,  definitely would stay again"
91,2886338,11/15/2012,Joaquin,"Raymond, you have a lovely apartment, thats well located and you are very nice. But I think it is important to comment that the apartment was not clean at all when I arrived (I know you had a deadline that day, but thats why we schedule things). Also I think it would've been appropriate that you would have let me know that you where going to have people over those days (1-2 very nice people).<br/><br/>On the other hand I can't avoid the fact that you are super nice so as your friends and I had a really good time talking with them. But sometimes it made me feel a little bit uncomfortable the fact that the apartment was so crowded.<br/>"
91,2931393,11/20/2012,Mariano,Nice house with a beatiful view and peaceful atmosphere. We spend a really nice weekend there. The owner it's very kind and you'll find your space and privacy.

91,3240593,1/3/2013,Huiling,"The house is very easy to find, and convenient. The room is clean and simple and Raymond is a very friendly host! Also his superrr cute cat. Just watch out when you leave your room or the flat, remember to keep the door closed, or the cat will run in and smell all your things, (probably some scratching too). The kitchen is dirty, but we didn't really cook so it's okay for us. "

91,3471685,2/4/2013,Kaden,"Raymond was awesome! Very pleasant person to talk to and he was very helpful in my nieve lack of planning. He provided a wonderful bed to sleep on and a towel fo the shower. I spent a good amount of time sleeping, since I was sick, but it was very comfortable and he was really easy to talk to and work with.<br/><br/>Definitly would stay again if he accepted."
91,3679654,3/3/2013,Juan Pablo,"Staying at RaymondÂ´s place was awesome !   it was a perfect place for me, exactly what i was looking for. He is a great man, i felt very confortable in his house. Just the fact of crossing the Voldenpark with my bike everyday to reach the city centre was very nice; and the neighborhood where he lives is nice and quiet. I hope to come back sometime in the future. Totally recommended !"
91,3897167,3/25/2013,John,"Raymond is a very welcoming host and made my stay at his place enjoyable.  While not in the heart of the attractions, Raymond's place is super-easy to get to via tram.  If you're looking for a comfortable place to stay while visiting Amsterdam, I recommend Raymond's guest room."
91,4108871,4/10/2013,Nirka,"I stayed for 5 nights at Raymond's. He is a great host. very nice and helpful. He is not in your way, and sometimes I was coming back very late/early but  he is a night bird working late so I didn't have to worry about waking him up. The room was very basic but comfortable. it is very close to the tram no 2 that takes you straight to the city center in less than 15 minutes so very good location for the value of money.<br/>His friends were also very nice and helpful.  <br/>the cat is quite a character, she will get in your suitcase one way or another or you will have to chase her down the street if she runs out:D"
91,4152757,4/14/2013,Irene,"Estuve en casa de Raymond solo una noche. Raymond fue simpÃ¡tico y me ayudÃ? en todo lo que le preguntÃ©. La casa es su lugar de trabajo, asÃ? que hubo flexibilidad en las horas de llegada y salida. La habitaciÃ?n era muy bÃ¡sica (no necesitaba mÃ¡s tampoco). Todo limpio. A la gata le gustÃ? mi maleta y casi se vuelve conmigo a EspaÃ±a."
91,4272403,4/23/2013,Samuel,"Raymond is a nice guy and has a cute cat. He is helpful in showing you around town and happy to show you Amsterdam nightlife. <br/>Make sure to ask Raymond a trampass you can charge yourself so your rides to the city centre will be at a reasonable price"

91,4892333,5/31/2013,Joshua,"Raymond was nice enough to let us leave our bags when we arrived early and was an easy going host. He has great taste in music and likes to be up late! Room is a little dirty but a nice place if you are backpacking through. I would suggest renting a bike during your stay, the ride through Vondelpark is very nice. Grab a club sandwich at Singel 404 for lunch (you will not regret it) "
56,3267689,1/4/2013,Chiara,"It has been a fantastic holiday. We really enjoyed Amsterdam and probably we will come back soon. The house was really confortable and cozy. We will love to come back to Hinde's house the next time.<br/>"

Thank you so much!<br/>"
56,12119771,4/23/2014,Cristina,"Hinde and her family welcome us very warmly. Staying in their house was comfortable and the apartment is very nice and full of light (and it was clean too).

Next time we'll go to Amsterdam, we will like to come to Hinde's house again!  <br/>"
56,19631404,9/15/2014,Henriette,"We had the most wonderful stay at this Mediterranean apartment located in the west of Amsterdam! The location was perfect for us, as we rented bikes right after arrival. The apartment itself was super cozy with a lovely balcony/kitchen which we used more then once to enjoy a bottle of red and cheese.  Since there were three of us, one of the girls had to sleep on the sofa in the living room, but from our experience this worked great and the sofa was very comfortable.<br/><br/>The communication and preparation arrangements with Hinde was very effective, and he provided us with everything we needed before arrival. <br/><br/>If we would ever go back to Amsterdam again, this would definitely be the apartment we would like to stay at!<br/><br/>Thank you!"
56,29412066,4/7/2015,Belen,"We loved staying at Hinde and Rafael's house. The house was perfect for our family of five. We had two cribs and a little bed for the kids. Also they loved to play with Chadi's toys. The house is great if you travel with kids. <br/><br/>The kitchen is very luminous and has all the necessary tools and tableware to cook at home. The apartment is conveniently located around 10 min. walk from tram 13 that takes you to central station. There are two super markets close to the house too. <br/><br/>If I had something to say I think the bathroom could have been a little cleaner. Anyway, it is a great and charming place to stay that I would definitely recommend. I want to thank Hinde and Rafael for being so nice and helpful with all our needs. "

56,139219441,3/24/2017,Emma,"Hinde's apartment was perfect for my friend and I during our week long stay in Amsterdam. Des Baarsjes was a perfect neighborhood, just far away enough from the city center to escape the crowds (and we didn't even go during peak tourist season), but right around the corner from several tram stops. There are several great restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood as well. We did not get to meet Hinde, but check in was very easy with their very flexible neighbor! Would stay here again, definitely."

The house is in convenient locality and 10-15 min distance from city centre by Tram/bus.<br/><br/>Whilst we found the house a bit cramped, but you will see everything is on it's right place and isn't an obstruction. The house  needs special care if you have small child, it would be good to be upfront with Hinde. The house is on the 3rd floor with no lift, be mindful if you are travelling with heavy luggage.<br/><br/>A great stay for our visit at Amsterdam."
56,185925863,8/23/2017,Michael,Everything was great staying here! I loved the house and location. It was convenient to get pretty much anywhere in Amsterdam. Would recommend to couples or a very small group of people.

56,588196624,1/4/2020,Amay,We had a wonderful time at Hinde's place. Would definitely recommend this place to others. It is close enough to transportation & has required amenities & shops close by.
56,607651988,2/18/2020,Maddie,"Great space! Plenty of space for the 3 of us (couple +1) staying there. I actually opted to sleep on the couch bc it was so big and comfortable! There is balcony access which is lovely, and the apartment is a very cozy and  in a great location. Hinde was very accommodating, responded quickly, check in was easy, all great things!"
81,3256441,1/3/2013,Jonathan,"The experience into a houseboat was really particular and exciting.<br/>The apartment was clean, brand new and really nice!<br/>To recommend for a unique experience in Amsterdam.<br/>The communication with the host was really simple and functioning. <br/>Thanks Harry for your kindness.<br/>"
81,3734064,3/9/2013,Beatrix,"We booked HarryÂ´s houseboat in the last minute but Harry confirmed it fast. The houseboat itself is very nice, we enjoyed our stay there. It is new, pleasant, has a nice atmosphere and the neighborhood is quiet. There is a good public transportation connection, you can reach the city center very easy. Harry is an excellent host!<br/>If you would like to stay in Amsterdam, this place is a great choice!"
81,3998394,4/2/2013,Raphaela,"We were four friends visiting Amsterdam and staying on Harry's houseboat was the best decision we could have made. It's brand new, very stylish with a great rooftop terrace and an awesome bathroom. The rooms are cozy and the beds (2 real ones) had good matresses. Only advice, bring towels (we had to buy some because we forgot to bring our own :-) )"
81,4070075,4/7/2013,Benjamin,"Harry loue une partie de sa splendide maison-bateau, toute neuve. Le lieu, un peu Ã  l'Ã©cart du centre-ville, est trÃ¨s calme et le cadre est trÃ¨s dÃ©paysant. On voit passer des cygnes par la fenÃªtre du salon ! Harry est trÃ¨s sympathique et accueillant, et il a meublÃ© sa maison avec goÃ»t et esprit pratique. "
81,4087780,4/8/2013,Samy,"Nice stay, and hosts. Clean and spacious, modern house boat. Would come again."
81,4254598,4/22/2013,James,"We stayed for two nights and overall our experience was fantastic. This property is in a great location that was quiet and relaxing but also very close to Amsterdam centre by tram (15 mins to central Amsterdam), which you can pick up at the end of the road (number 16 or 24). <br/><br/>The accommodation itself was comfortable, very clean, modern and decorated to a very high standard. It also has great roof deck and just being on the water was such a novelty for us we really enjoyed it. <br/><br/>There are four brand new bikes which you can use free of charge and we cycled to a local park (Amsterdam Bose) that was more like a forest, which was amazing to cycle around. If you like the outdoors this is the place for you. You can have a bit of nature and the city all in one weekend. <br/><br/>Harry thanks again we will hopefully be back again soon! "
81,4304944,4/26/2013,Christian,"Very stylish houseboat in a nice and quite location of Amsterdam. It takes you a 15min bustransfer and a 10 minute walk from Schiphol Airport to get there by public transport. The houseboat is located next to the Olympic Stadium and surrounded by sports fields (tennis, soccer, icehockey, etc.) and of course water. <br/>The housboat is brand new, is very clean, modern and stylsish. The location is designed for up to 4 guests with 2 bedrooms, 2 Bathrooms, lovely roof terrace and of course 4 brand new bikes. It was a pleasure to get arround with them in Amsterdam. It takes you about 5 minutes to the Vondelpark by bike and another 10 minutes to the City Center. If you go the opposite direction you will get in 5-10 Minutes to the Amsterdam Forest (Amsterdam Bos). <br/>We really enojed our stay in this location. As Harry lives just next door even our late arrival was no problem. Thanks again for this. I really can recomend this location to everyone who wantâÄôs to stay stylish and relaxed. <br/>"
81,4337569,4/29/2013,Mette,"A weekend on a houseboat is just so Amsterdam-ish! Everything  worked out perfectly at Harry & AnnaÂ´s. Staying in a houseboat community felt very home-like. Bikes were great and having to come in to town from a bit longer distance than if you stay right downtown makes you see new and really nice parts of Amst. Our hosts gave us some real good tips on where to eat.<br/>"
81,4381307,5/1/2013,Clotilde,"Appartement trÃ¨s agrÃ©able pour son lieu, son espace, son Ã©quipement. On se sens chez soi. Un havre de paix. Accueil trÃ¨s sympathique. "
81,4489835,5/8/2013,Alexander,"Nice houseboat. Two floors + sunroof. One bedroom is large enough, another - a bit small for two persons.<br/><br/>A bit far from center, but Harry provided bikes for us, so it wasn't a problem.<br/><br/>New experience.<br/><br/>Overall impression - 4+/5"
81,4596599,5/14/2013,Irene,"Harry and Anna's boathouse is absolutely wonderful! It is designed perfectly - we were  4 people and yet there was more than enough space. The decor and facilities were lovely - made you feel right at home. I have no words about the setting which was idylic to say the least - completely in touch with nature yet very close to the center of Amsterdam (about 10-12 minutes by tram, which is about a 5 minutes walk from the house. The tram stops along all the points of interests such as museums, shopping, etc. so basically you can hop on and off. Two tram lines are perfect for this - 16 and 24. You can also take these from Central Station directly to the house and then it is a 5 minute walk to the house.)). It is a perfect place to relax and to visit the city at the same time. We are looking forward to coing back for a longer stay soon!<br/>Harry and Anna were perfect hosts, lovely to talk to and very professional about how they run this property. Bravo!<br/>(4 bikes also come with this property which is a great touch- also the location is perfect for running. There are no supermarkets in very close walking distance from what I saw, but it is easy to get to quickly get to one by bike and of course all sorts of restaurants deliver)."
81,4640401,5/17/2013,Ludwiga,"Wir verbrachten leider nur 2 NÃ?chte auf dem Hausboot und haben uns dort sehr wohl gefÃ?hlt. Harry ist ein sehr freundlicher Gastgeber, er wohnt direkt nebenan, so dass man jederzeit schnell Kontakt hÃ?tte haben kÃ¶nnen. Man wohnt wie in einem kleinen Dorf, mit dem Rad nur 10 Minuten vom Zentrum entfernt. Wir hatten eine sehr schÃ¶ne Zeit und mÃ¶chten gern wiederkommen. <br/>Richard und Ludwiga"
81,4789623,5/26/2013,Kevin,"This place is awesome. Who wouldn't want to stay on a houseboat? The interior is more or less impeccable (looks fairly new), and accommodated three of us quite comfortably. It's a little ways from the city center, but with the bikes that were provided, it was very easy to get there (riding through the city on bikes was actually one of the highlights of my trip...given how bike-friendly Amsterdam is, I would consider that a must). If bikes aren't your thing, it's also right next to a tram stop (less than 10 minute walk). Harry was very nice and accommodating (and funny, not surprisingly) - he took the time to walk us through everything, and provided quite a bit in the way of recommendations for restaurants, things to check out, etc. Overall great experience, would highly recommend."
81,4810284,5/27/2013,Carmen,"We stayed for one night at this gorgeous location. It is easy to find by car and bus- and tram-station aren't far away. Nevertheless it is located in a very calm area. The houseboat looks brandnew and was very clean. Very friendly hosts!<br/>We hope, we will be able to return to this nice place and have a longer stay! "
81,4889506,5/31/2013,Thomas,"Me and two friends stayed for four nights in this amazing houseboat, which is easily big enough for four. It's very modern with some quaint (Website hidden by Airbnb) in a quiet, relaxing area which is still close enough to central Amsterdam. The area is near other sites you might otherwise miss. We took the bikes that come with the property to Amsterdam Forest, which is only about 10 minutes away. <br/><br/>The nearest shops aren't too far away, around a 15 minute walk. But there is a petrol station near the stadium for basics and snacks. There are good transport connections in the area, the tram, buses, and Amsterdam Zuid station is about a ten minute walk.<br/><br/>Harry was very friendly and welcoming, and I'd stay here again!"
81,5009260,6/7/2013,Frank And Margy,"Harry and Anna were lovely. Harry picked us up when we came in ( we became a little lost from the airport). The houseboat is beautiful and clean. Everything we needed. Short walk to tram or bus. We actually rode the bikes downtown one day. <br/>There were four adults and two small children in the boat and we were quite comfortable.<br/>Great hosts... thank you Harry and Anna for a wonderful stay!"
81,5057827,6/10/2013,Manu & Marion,"We really enjoyed the houseboat  and Amsterdam is an amazing city! We'll come back for sure and will recommend it to friends. <br/>Thanks to Harry & Anna for their kindness and hospitality."
81,5105781,6/12/2013,Enrique,"We were with my wife to Amsterdam like a first step of a long anniversary journey. Harry and Anna were are wonderful persons.<br/>The value proposal of the place is exactly as the airbnb web page appears. The interior is impeccable and looks (Website hidden by Airbnb) very close to Amsterdam Downtown. You have several  transportation alternatives. Bike, Tram, Bus, or even Taxi (is not necessary).<br/>For example the bike route thru the neighborhood is amazing. Thanks Harry and Anna"
81,5179146,6/17/2013,Feda,It was a very nice stay. Harry was always helpful and the house boat is the perfect stay for Amsterdam!
81,5247764,6/20/2013,Nina,"Harry and Anna were super helpful, giving us tips on how to get to their lovely house boat and were flexible with meeting us with the keys.  The house boat is BEAUTIFUL! Definitely added to the Amsterdam expeience!"

81,5457129,7/1/2013,Yvonne,"Fabulous stay in this spacious immaculate houseboat.  Anna was a super host and very accommadating.  I have already referred many people and would love to stay here again.  Great people - great place.  Thanks Anna<br/><br/>"
81,6047168,7/28/2013,Luke,"A beautiful houseboat, exactly as the photos show. The 16 & 24 trams go right into the centre of Amsterdam or you can cycle for 15 minutes on the bikes provided. Have recommended it to my parents who are going to visit in autumn and would also recommend it to anyone else. <br/><br/>Harry & Anna weren't there when we stayed but Harry's parents were and they were very helpful and accommodating."
81,6148442,8/1/2013,Sinead,"We loved Harry and Anna's houseboat! It was very beautiful and such a different experience. So much better than staying at a hotel. It was very close to town, only a 10 minute bike ride. The bikes were an added bonus. Would recommend this place to everyone! "
81,6201052,8/3/2013,Barbara,"The first thing you need to know is that the first photo you see of the home is NOT the one you will be renting. That one is the owners. You will not be sitting out on that lovely deck overlooking the canal. You will be in the unit behind that with a view of the home next door. There is a deck on top, but it is not a charming deck like the one pictured. Otherwise, the place was clean and attractive and no other complaints. The owner's dad checked us in, helped us find the cheap parking, and was very nice. We appreciated the bikes. "
81,6417934,8/12/2013,Nina,"A very nice place to stay! We spent 10 days in Amsterdam with the houseboat as our platform and we enjoyed the quietness of the neighborhood along with the very spacious and comfortable houseboat. So nice to wake up and see the water everyday, and so nice to sit on the roof terrace at night. Anna and Harry are such kind people who make sure that everything concerning your stay in the houseboat is as it should be. The bicycles included made it so easy to explore the city and therefore we enjoyed it even more! Dank u woll!"
81,6532601,8/16/2013,Karen,"Our stay in Harry & Anna's houseboat was very nice. It was very quiet at night so made for easy sleeping. We enjoyed riding the bicycles that they included with the rental. It was a nice way to see the city, though it took a little bit of learning to figure out how to maneuver all of the other bicycle, scooter, tram, and car traffic. The houseboat was very clean and spacious. We enjoyed relaxing on the rooftop deck and watching boats pass by in the channel near where the houseboat is located. It was also nice to be able to cook our own breakfast in the houseboat's kitchen so we didn't need to find a restaurant in the mornings. Anna also did us a favor by arranging for a taxi to pick us up to take us to the airport when we needed to leave Amsterdam since our phones were not always working properly while we were in Europe. She even sent her parents with a note to inform us she had made the arrangements since we were not likely to see her that evening. She also assisted in our comfort by providing a fan to use while we slept since we are used to using one. Riding bicycles or taking the tram to the city center or other Amsterdam neighborhoods was easy to figure out. We would definitely recommend staying at their houseboat to others."
81,6640573,8/19/2013,John,"mooie accommodatie, prima sanitair en degelijke fietsen."
81,6805447,8/26/2013,Stefania,"The house is really nice and confortable, the area is super quiet and relaxing, neighbours are so lovely and friendly you can't believe it. Harry and Anna are great hosts, very nice, polite and helpful. We had a great time in Amsterdam, thanks to all the beautiful people we met.<br/>"
81,7066129,9/5/2013,Sue,"Unfortunately for us, our taxi driver dropped us at the wrong end of Jachtshavenweg, despite me giving him a piece of paper with Harry's directions on it. Anyway after an hour of dragging suitcases along the streets and bike paths we found the Houseboat. Harry & Anna welcomed us with a cold drink and snack. The houseboat is quite spacious and was very comfortable for the three of us. We enjoyed bike riding in the Forest but preferred to use trams to get into the city. Harry was very helpful with directions for the local grocery store, Albert Heijn and where to catch public transport.<br/>We really enjoyed the novelty of staying on a houseboat.<br/>Thank you Harry & Anna."
81,7122662,9/7/2013,Elise,"Although the house was a little difficult to find, it was absolutely beautiful and we wish we had stayed there longer!  The use of complementary bikes was also very nice."

81,7237649,9/13/2013,Annika,"My boyfriend, two friends of us and I, spent 4 nights at Annas and Harrys gorgeous houseboat. <br/>Even it rains a lot during our stay in Amsterdam our holiday was not a flop, because of our great accommodation. The houseboat was clean and cozy and we used the kitchen to cook a lot of delicious meals. Also we had so much fun cruising around in Amsterdam with the bikes. Therefore we used the bus to get to the Jachtshavenweg and had no problems to find the pier. The area was really nice and quiet and Anna gave us a warm welcome. <br/><br/>We can recommend Annas and Harrys place to everyone who likes to have a memorable time in Amsterdam and we would always stay again at the houseboat! <br/>"

81,7459470,9/21/2013,Renee,"We loved the houseboat, and Harry was very helpful. We wish we could of stayed longer. We really enjoyed using the bikes to go explore the beautiful city, it is very generous of Harry to include them. Beware, however, I did have a peeping Tom! Turned out it was a gorgeous white swan that floats around with his duck buddies shaking the neighborhood down for goodies! He floated right up to the bedroom window. How cool is that? Thanks for everything, Harry!"

Excellent value for money and did absolutely everything it said on the tin."

Me and my boyfriend felt like being locals and that was wonderful for us. <br/>Even though we didn't have the chance to meet Ekaterina personaly due to the fact that she was abroad, she was very nice with us and was able to arrange our coming perfectly. <br/>Missy is a very quiet cat and easy to take care of.<br/>We certainly recomend Ekaterina's place to a great vacation in Amsterdam."
7,89689690,7/29/2016,Tobias,"We had a fantastic experience staying at Ekaterina's and Thomas' apartment. We found it exactly as described, with pretty much everything we could wish for - even a furry flatmate (their cat is super cute). Supermarkets and cafÃ©s are nearby, and you can get to the city center in less than 20 minutes. Furthermore, our hosts were very quick in responding to our messages and Thomas provided us with a whole lot of tips for our stay. Highly recommended!"
7,90826565,8/2/2016,Agathe,TrÃ¨s bon sÃ©jour !! 
7,92837107,8/10/2016,Shadforth,We stayed at Ekaterina's place for 4 nights and it was really perfect. At first I was a bit worried about the cat being in the apartment but after the first night we realized that this is such adorable cat. You really don't need to worry for it. It even slept by our feet on the bed ;) <br/><br/>I would recommend this place for sure in Amsterdam and I know we will be back in the near future. 
7,99219338,9/4/2016,Leslie,"Just go for it, hosts are so nice and made every thing easy, appartement is clean and the area is no nice. Everything was perfect !"
7,107630404,10/11/2016,Elisa,Everything was perfect! Ekaterina is a really nice person and did everything to make our stay relaxing. The apartment is clean and cozy and the cat Missy is super cute. Thank you very much for everything :) I would definitly recommend your apartment and come back some day!
7,174198680,7/25/2017,Kate,Lovely apartment in great location. Excellent communication and very lovely cat
7,190086348,9/3/2017,Fredrik,The location of the apartment is great. It seems to be a young and vibrant area. There are a lot of cafes and it is rather close to the city center. The building is rather old but the apartment was perfectly clean. You have to be aware that there is a cat in the apartment of which you have to take care but that is okay if you don't mind cats. For our weekend stay the apartment was appropriate and Amsterdam is always worth a visit!
7,250247590,4/4/2018,Filippo,Ci siamo trovati molto bene nella casa di Ekaterina. Appartamento molto pulito e luminoso. Ekaterina ha sempre risposto prontamente alle nostre domande ed Ã¨ stata molto gentile e disponibile. La casa non Ã¨ in pieno centro ma facilmente raggiungibile con i mezzi pubblici. LâÄôunico âÄúneoâÄù riguarda il bagno della casa che Ã¨ un poâÄô scomodo.
7,530071052,9/15/2019,Gina,Sehr schÃ¶ne Unterkunft mit guter Anbindung zur Bahn. Problemloser Check In. Sehr saubere Wohnung mit gemÃ?tlichem Balkon.

58,12553398,5/5/2014,Anna,"We had a fantastic time at this lovely apartment in the Jordan. It had everything we needed and was clean, bright and spacious.<br/><br/>Really handy having the bicycles, it was about a 15-20 minute cycle into town.<br/><br/>We had a delicious Turkish breakfast at Mamoud round the corner, and there is also a supermarket nearby - the kitchen had everything we needed and it was nice to stay in with a home cooked meal and play scrabble. Some choice DVDs in the flat meant we spent a lovely evening watching Peep Show the day after a night out on the town!<br/><br/>Would recommend this apartment for anyone wanting a comfortable, easy and relaxing break in Amsterdam.<br/>"
58,12841476,5/12/2014,Maxime,"Jason & Lotte's apartment is great, we really enjoy our 4-night stay there. Grocery store is very close, and it is well connected with the center and the Central Station (one bus line, 2 trams).<br/>Jason & Lotte were really nice and responsive. We didn't have the chance to meet them but they left a lot of useful information (+ beer and wine!) for us.<br/>I definitely recommend a stay at their place!"
58,15355977,7/7/2014,Rosie,"Jason and lotties apartment was great!! They were great hosts and quick to reply to queries. Easy transport links close by. Harry the cat was an extra bonus (and the balcony)!! Thanks so much for our stay guys, we loved it!"

79,12578861,5/5/2014,Ricardo,"I apologize for having taken so long to write this evaluation.<br/><br/>Wouter is an excellent host. He keeps the house extremely clean. Furthermore, even though he didn't need to do that, he left me food and beverages.<br/><br/>I had a minor problema during the first evening. When I called him for help, he solved the problema immediately by resorting to ione of his neighbors (which shows that he gets along well with people).<br/><br/>It's not a luxury apartment, but it's well located for people who like museums and concerts."
79,14939040,6/29/2014,Brice,"Wouter was a great host, he takes care of us with wine, food, breakfast and many explanation. The location is great, close to the tram, museum, shops, restaurants and pubs in the main street. The apartment was more than expected. I would highly recommend this place for a nice weekend in Amsterdam"
79,18286959,8/24/2014,Bram,Wouter welcomed me very kindly and showed me his cosy apartment.   I had a wonderful stay in the middle of Amsterdam!

The Apartment is well located in de pijp, i think there is no better Place to be. You have everything around but the Apartment is in a street, which is more quiet. <br/>Thank you Wouter and i hopefully we see us soon! "
79,21184604,10/12/2014,Luana,It was a good stay ! Wouter is a very good host.
79,22547309,11/9/2014,Mark,We had a great weekend. Communication in booking with Wouter was very easy. It's a very cosy place in a very nice part of town. I'd be happy to come again any time. 
79,22869255,11/16/2014,Fleur,"We had such a fantastic weekend at Wouter's apartment, and Wouter made us feel very welcome from the moment we arrived, showing us around, taking the time to give us tips and ideas of great places to visit and eat during our stay as well as providing breakfast items so we wouldn't have to go out and buy things after our evening arrival - very thoughtful. He had been easy to get hold of and quick to respond in arranging the stay and had even given us detailed instructions and timings on getting to the apartment from the airport.<br/><br/>The apartment itself is in a great location on a lovely quiet street with a balcony that overlooks gardens, but just a short walk from great places to eat and go out in de Pijp. Getting into town was a lovely and easy 20 minute walk or 5 minutes on the tram. It was spotlessly clean and had everything we could need for our stay.<br/><br/>Thanks so much Wouter, hope we can come back soon!"
79,26573521,2/15/2015,Natalie,"Wouter is so helpful and easy-going, his place is perfect for a short trip to Amsterdam - right in the thick pf De Pijp with restaurants and bars in walking distance. We had a great time!"
79,27306463,3/1/2015,Tim,"We had a wonderful time staying at this place! This apartment is very clean, cozy and has a soul of its own. <br/>I'd be happy to have such a beautiful home myself.  <br/>"
79,28755552,3/29/2015,Kelly,"We had a great time at Wouter's place - the apartment is comfortable and clean and in an excellent location.  And Wouter is incredibly helpful and nice, making our stay that much better!"
79,29171385,4/5/2015,Eva," Wouter was very kind and helpful. He gave some notes with good bars and restaurants. The apartment is not in the real center, but the neighborhood is very good with smart places for breakfast just around the corner. The main museums are about 10 minutes walk. The apartment was very clean and well equipped.  And it  gave exactly the same comfort as it was described on the website. "
79,30219896,4/19/2015,Helle,"We had a great stay in Wouter's apartment - it seems big, even though  it isn't, with big windows and a really nice and sunny terrace. <br/>Wouter welcomed us and was really pleasant and helpful. Also he had left some food for us to take, which was really great after a day of traveling. <br/>All in all - we would love to stay at this place again, if we return to Amsterdam! "
79,31779137,5/10/2015,Pauline,"We had a wonderful time at Wouter's appartment ! It is cozy, clean and well equipped, in a very quiet environnement but not far away from lively places with shops, restaurants and bars. The tram station is very close too. Wouter was very kind and gave us recommandations on good places to eat in the neighboorhood.<br/><br/>Note that a bearded dragon lives in the appartement ! A perfect roommate : both funny and quiet."
79,32999766,5/24/2015,Elena,"Wouter answered to my request very quick and was in touch in any questions. He is very nice and frendly - helped us with luggage (no lift there!), told about area, gave some advices about nearest cafe, shops, bike rentals etc. and also presented one bottle of wine, as ""welcome"", thanks!<br/><br/>The flat is not in center, but quite near: to Central Station is about 40 minutes by foot, to main places it takes from 10 till 20 minutes. We prefer walking, but you can use tram, the station is near. <br/>Very quiet neighborhood and nice market 5 minutes away from flat with fresh fruits, vegetables and flowers! <br/><br/>This flat is better for short stay, cos there are not enough place for your things and clothes (Wouter usually lives here, so there are many his things, of course). But all was really clean and kitchen is well equipment, if you like cooking.<br/><br/>Two notes - there is a small dragon, he is really quiet, but I felt some specific smell from it (not bad, just specific). And it was a little cold for me, I think because of windows (big and quite old), but this is usual problem for Europe in spring.<br/><br/>So, it was nice time in Amsterdam, thanks!"
79,33736177,5/31/2015,Charlotte,"We had an enjoying weekend at Wouter's appartment. The place is very convenient, clean and cozy well located in a quiet street with a balcony overlooking a nice garden.<br/>Wouter gave us some tips such a very good bakery nearby (yummy appleflap!). He provided us delicious cooked pasta so we wouldn't have to go out the evening we arrived. <br/>Thank you so much again !"
79,34361499,6/7/2015,Vishal,I booked Wouter' apartment for my mother and sister when they visited Amsterdam. They said the location was superb. It was super close to bus and train stations and a short walk would take you to where all the things were happening. Water's apartment was very nice and clean and really made their stay. I would recommend it to others
79,40976325,8/3/2015,Denise,Wouter was an amazing host. He was very flexible with a change I had to do to the trip last minute. We had the opportunity to share dinner (he is a great cook) and he gave us good advice on how to explore Amsterdam. The apartment is neat and very well located.
79,42958730,8/16/2015,Ignacia,"The apartments is just like in the pictures. The location is great, full of shops and restaurantds around and walking distance from the museums. "

We had a warm welcome from Wouter and all our communication was straightforward. The location was great for us - there's lots of bars, restaurants & cafÃ©s nearby, plus it's easy to get elsewhere in the city. The nearby brewery was a particularly good recommendation! We would definitely stay again."
79,71138894,4/24/2016,Ksenia,Wouter is a greatest host. We have followed his recommendations and where not disappointed! The apartment is super cozy. Perfect experience. Would definitely stay there again. Recommended 100%.

79,83398917,7/2/2016,Mathias,"Everything was near perfect with Wouter and his place: fluid communication, great place, good location (de pijp is really a great district), Wouter even offered us a bottle of wine to start the journey! <br/>So yes everything was perfect except for the presence of a mouse in the apartment... Wouter warned us not to leave food outside and we didn't. So we were fine even though it is questionable in terms of hygiene, but if you are freaked by them I would suggest to choose another place.<br/>Otherwise, and again, everything else was great - thanks Wouter!"
79,86625541,7/17/2016,Myriam,"This place is perfect ! Very well located in a very Nice area With a lot of Nice places to eat and have a drink. After 4 days in Amsterdam, we say that it's the Best place in Amsterdam. Really Nicer than the center full of tourists. It's Very Quick to go to the center, walking or With the tramway. <br/>The appartment has everything you need, the bed is comfy and it's reaaaally silent in the flat. There's a little terrace Where you can enjoy the sun. <br/>Wouter is a perfect host, and gave us a bottle of wine for our arrival and a bowl full of fruits. I recommend this place ++++."

18,16423051,7/27/2014,Ute,"Rob's house is lovely located inmids museums and the Concertgebouw, close to bus, tram and supermarket. Being allowed to use his bike was most joyful.<br/>I didn't meet rob personally, instead I was picked up and shown around by his girlfriend;<br/>Thousands of books in the flat, a wonderful BÃ¶sendorfer grand, which I used intensively and a comfortable bed gave me the peaceful surroundings that I wished. The kitchen equipment rather on the rudimentary side, no problem however for me.<br/>Any time again!<br/>"
18,17075400,8/6/2014,Vivian,Amazing home and perfect location. Rob was very friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend this apartment!
18,20933169,10/7/2014,Erez,"I stayed at Rob's house over the weekend with a friend, and we had a great time. The house is spacious and cosy.

18,43326085,8/18/2015,Stephanie,"It was a great home base while staying in Amsterdam. There are lots of stairs, but this is to be expected in Amsterdam. The apartment was exactly as advertised. Rob was an easy going host. Rob was there at our scheduled check in time. Comfy bed, and warm shower. We had a great time. "
18,44375715,8/25/2015,Jean,Rob nous a mis Ã  l'aise tout de suite. Visite du lieu et explication fonctionnelle du logement nous ont convenu. Le quartier est tranquille et proche des principaux musÃ©es ainsi que du tram (ligne 5)...
18,102881009,9/19/2016,Anna,"Ich hatte einen sehr schÃ¶nen Aufenthalt in Amsterdam. Es ist eine nette Wohnung in einem ruhigen Viertel und die Verkehrsanbindung ist auch sehr gut. Die SchlÃ?sselÃ?bergabe hat gut funktioniert und ich fÃ?hlte mich gleich wie zu Hause. Alles hat super gepasst und ich kann diese Wohnung nur weiter empfehlen, man darf nur keine Angst vor zu vielen Stufen haben :D"
18,131383949,2/12/2017,Janis,This is a well located apartment at the very top of the building with many stairs on which you have to take care. they are dramatic and steep.<br/>It was good exercise however if you didn't have to go in and out several times. The large bed was excellent and I slept very well. Layout is open plan  with  a lovely dining table - and toilets on each floor. Rob was away and his neighbour kindly let me in so to have it to myself was a bonus. <br/>Shower room was surprisingly basic but overall it was good value .<br/>I liked the area and I walked everywhere in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) was quiet and light being so high up.
83,11786732,4/14/2014,Erin,"Such a welcoming and friendly host! Great room, great view, great accommodations! So glad we found this place!!!!"
83,12303395,4/28/2014,Lene,"We had a great stay at Ricks -the room and the whole apartment were very tidy, provided with clean towels and bed sheets -and good coffee :)! Rick was very nice and easy going and made us feel very comfortable! "
83,12440800,5/2/2014,Olessia,"Rick is a very nice person who radiates bliss and calm. <br/>The apt is located in a peaceful and very green neighborhood. It was interesting to stay there to see the real life of Amsterdamers, not the touristy side of the city. It is 15 minutes from Schiphol by car/ 20 mins by train and it's 20 minutes from the city center by foot. The main attraction for me was the park that begins right behind the apartment block. Awesome place!<br/>I can also say that the pictures don't give the credit to the room. It is better in reality: it is full of light and it overlooks the park. The only thing is the room is not spacious, the better part of it is taken by the bed. <br/>The bathroom is rather big and very clean. <br/>I enjoyed my stay immensely and can highly recommend the place. "
83,13148993,5/20/2014,Emilia,"Dear Rick, I am very gratefull to find such a beatifull human been and a wonderfull host.<br/>It feels like home and it was nice to always have a host / friend to share my adventures / discoveries in the magnificent Amsterdam.<br/>I found a wonderful host and left a friend. <br/>Gratefull to you.<br/><br/>"
83,13200811,5/21/2014,Helge,"Two words: Highly recommended. Thank you Rick, what a good start on my stay in the Netherlands :-) The apartment and the room is very nice, comfortable and clean. <br/><br/>Rick is uniquely interested in making your stay as good as possible."
83,13440349,5/27/2014,Thomas,Rick was very sympathic and helpfull. He made everything possible for a perfect Amsterdam's trip. His appartement is very confortable and the Rembrant Park (where the building is) is very beautifull. The room was clean and the view very beautifull. Perfect B&B for me! Thanks Rick!
83,13685901,6/2/2014,Louisa,Rick was very nice and helpful. The flat is clean and comfortable. I definitely would stay at this place again. There is also a Park around. You can easily take the tram to the City Center. 
83,13973188,6/9/2014,Alexandra,"I stayed at Rick's for two nights this week, having been to Amsterdam once before. It's definitely a very good option - excellent value for the price, for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1 The rooms is clean, spacious, nicely furnished, bathroom and kitchen are modern and well equipped.<br/><br/>2 The kitchen and living room areas are comfortable and the balcony is a good asset. Breakfast was good - lots of choice of fresh fruit, cereals, yogurt and decent tea.<br/><br/>3 Rick's place is very well placed for exploring the city and the green areas on inline skates or bike: The apartment is located in Rembrandtpark and just a few 10mins cycling from Vondelpark. It is also well connected with the city center by tram, bus and metro. <br/><br/>4 Rick is a wonderful host and I would gladly return to his B&B: I loved the yogurt with fresh strawberries and kiwis. I brought my inline skates and easily skated across the parks and to many wonderful places in the city.<br/>"
83,14209206,6/14/2014,Chris,"I had a wonderful stay in Rick's apartment. The room was very nice with lots of natural light and a great view. The apartment was clean and comfortable. The apartment was in a great location, next to the park. <br/><br/>Rick is a welcoming host and is very accommodating. There were maps and guidebooks upon entering. He offered fresh fruit and yogurt and opened up his kitchen to the guests, which is rare on airbnb. <br/><br/>Overall, I would definitely stay there again. "
83,14454055,6/19/2014,Jaspreet,"First time with Airbnb and I guess there's nothing better I could have asked for. Rick is an excellent host. His place had the all the arrangements - maps, bike info, museum info, etc and located in a very peaceful and beautiful surrounding with park.<br/><br/>The apartment was very clean and tidy, open kitchen with great breakfast options and spacious enough room with comfortable bed. The airport pickup by Paul, a helpful guy, was an excellent arrangement too.<br/><br/>Rick is a smart and intelligent person to converse with, we talked a lot into the midnight and had interesting conversations.<br/><br/>I will surely stay here whenever I plan to come back to Amsterdam!"
83,14522134,6/21/2014,Philipp,I had an awesome stay at Rick's. He is a highly engaged host and did everything possible to make my stay as comftable as possible. Thank you very much! I will probably come back soon as I have to travel to Amsterdam more regulary from now on. 
83,14587910,6/22/2014,Dominic,Rick was very accomodating. Our flight was delayed and he was more than happy to meet us at a different time. He is of couse very friendly and polite. 
83,15118722,7/2/2014,Andrew,"Rick's apartment is an excellent place to stay in Amsterdam. It's not central but is only a short walk from a good tram connection, or a pleasant walk into the city. From the 12th floor you get great views, including over the adjacent park. The furnishings and fittings are of a high standard and Rick is a very neat and tidy person.<br/><br/>He's also an excellent airbnb host, easy and interesting to talk to and helpful with tips about his city. The museum card is a wonderful bonus for guests! Good wifi. Nice breakfast provisions.  A real 'make yourself at home' attitude.<br/><br/>I'd very happily stay here again, and highly recommend Rick's place."
83,15192987,7/4/2014,Alok,Rick is a very nice and polite gentleman. He ensures that you are given the utmost comfort while you are staying at his apartment. I felt really nice to meet Rick 
83,15269108,7/6/2014,Jason,"Rick is the perfect host - extremely personable and friendly, and went beyond my expectations to ensure my visit was comfortable and pleasurable.  The room was superb - excellent views of Amsterdam throughout the flat.  His decorating tastes are impeccable - the nice art, decorations and furniture provide a sophisticated yet very personable atmosphere.  The location was perfect for me, for it's just a short bike ride (or tram ride) to all the action in the center of Leidseplein square (and then onwards to Amsterdam central).  I'd recommend a stay with Rick 10 times over - you will not be dissappointed!<br/>"
83,15555966,7/11/2014,Shuyang,"I had an awesome stay at Rick's in Amsterdam. The apartment on the whole is very nice and efficiently operated. Breakfast was a great touch. <br/><br/><br/><br/>"
83,15871501,7/17/2014,Howard,"Rick was the consummate host.  He was warm and friendly and gave me good recommendations for places to visit.  He even took me out to dinner for my birthday! <br/><br/>His place is beautiful and is exactly as described in the listing. I found it very easy to get to the tram and to buses to get around the city. "
83,15942905,7/18/2014,Sayuri,"Rick is wonderful and very nice host. If you plan to visit Amsterdam, I highly recommend you to be a guest there. The view from your room and balcony are spacious and very good. I made a salad to get smoked salmon at a supermarket near there and ate it in the balcony. It was amazing. Try it! Also dining and kitchen are also very comfortable and high sense as you see in his pictures. There is a Rembrant park that is quiet and peaceful near the place. That park is my favorite in Amsterdam. You'd like if you can see. Additionally I liked to eat fruits and drink some tea and juice in the kitchen he kindly offers."
83,16120002,7/22/2014,Amine,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at Rick's gorgeous apartment for 4 days. Everything about our stay was perfect! Rick offered to pick us up at the airport, so finding the place was super easy :) the breakfast was great! And what a great idea to make it self service! The bed was nice, the view was AMAZING, and the location was perfect. This has honestly been the best place I've stayed with airbnb ever. Beside how great the place was, Rick and his friend were extremely nice and friendly, and we're a big part of making our vacation perfect :)"
83,16231699,7/23/2014,Amit,Ric's place was great place to stay after i had a long and tired journey. It was Great to talk to Emilia who made sure I had everything i needed at the house. A little far from the city center but a perfect place for those who want to relax and enjoy the park. Laundry is available for 20 euros which I think is high!
83,16304025,7/25/2014,Deb,"Beautiful apartment, extremely hospitable, very clean and I had a wonderful stay.  Thank you so much for offering your home through airbnb! "
83,16524249,7/28/2014,Alina,Very nice experience! Ricks roommate welcomed us warmly and showed us around. We found the place to be a stylish and outstandingly clean apartment and felt very comfortable from the beginning. The kitchen was more than fully equipped and we could choose out of a big variety of food and drinks. Rick showed up only a little later. He was a very gentle and caring host. We really enjoyed our stay and can highly recommend this comfy place.  
83,17208229,8/9/2014,Braden,"Rick provided friendly, comfortable, and convenient accommodation in Amsterdam. The apartment, although a 15min tram ride and 10min walk from the middle of the city, is on the edge of beautiful Rembrandt park, and is peaceful and quiet with astonishing views. I appreciated Rick and his housemate's attentiveness and help. I would not hesitate to recommend Rick to my friends and family, and would happily stay with him again on subsequent trips to Amsterdam."
83,17462976,8/12/2014,Fiona,"Rick was an excellent host, very welcoming and always asking if there was any way he make our stay more comfortable. The location was fantastic, a quick bike ride into the city centre. He was fantastic by supplying breakfast and recommending other great places in the city to visit. The apartment itself was extremely clean and well taken care of, we were extremely happy with the reservation, and will defiantly recommend it to any staying in the city! "
83,17576796,8/14/2014,Nataliya,"Rick is an excellent host who takes care of visitors. Cleanness is everywhere which is so important when different people come for  some days. I am glad to have been his guest and would like to visit him again. Besides, the location of the appartment is right next to the wonderful park. No words to express its beauty!"
83,17781973,8/17/2014,Eric,"Pour notre premier sÃ©jour Ã  Amsterdam nous avons choisis airbnb pour notre hÃ©bergement, ce fÃ»t aussi notre premiÃ¨re expÃ©rience de ce type.

83,17832378,8/18/2014,Sarita,"Rick and Emilia are very nice person. the place is very clean and wonderful. <br/>I really like Rick's painting on the wall. it looks very cool :)<br/>and I can prepare my own breakfast, it was very nice to me :D<br/>but it was a little bit sad, I could not say goodbye when I left. because my flight was very early morning, and I tried to knock Emilia's door, but seems like Emilia was still sleeping. but anyway, it was very nice place!!!!!!!!!!!"
83,18326571,8/25/2014,Mike,"Wow! Where do I begin. Rick was immensely accommodating. He let me use, unexpectedly, his bike, a museum pass. He had lots of food in the fridge even though I didn't partake that much . the room and house was very clean, well ordered, with great art and appointments. The view from the large bedroom window has a magnificent vista of Rembrandt park. while not in the city center, it is an easy,d delightful bike ride to the center."
83,18562279,8/28/2014,Oleksandr,Rick and Emilia are wonderful and extremely friendly people who made our staying literally great. Neighborhood is just perfect and really easy to get to the city center. Flat is clean and design is superb. :) Highly recommend! :)

83,18991579,9/4/2014,Gerard,I enjoyed staying with Rick very much.  His residence is very neat and it is no problem at all getting to the heart of the city.

83,19301445,9/9/2014,Michael,"Rick is very friendly and hospitable, he let me use his bike and museum card to get around this city which made the stay in Amsterdam very enjoyable. The place is very clean and beautifully decorated. It  had plenty of breakfast in stock, the room overlooks the park and you can get to the city center with a 15-20 min bike ride. Overall it was a great stay!"
83,19380773,9/11/2014,Nicholas,"Rick was a great host. I never actually met him but he arranged for his friend to be there to give me keys and show me around. The apartment and room were spotless and have a nice high view including a balcony. The location is quiet and pleasant in a tree-filled park, and it's an easy direct bike ride of only 10-15 minutes into the city center area.<br/><br/>Rick also provided complimentary breakfast, a bike for me to rent, and laundry machines in the apartment I could use for a fee. He even had a museum card I borrowed to go to museums for free, which more than offset the cost of the bike and laundry!  I was very happy with the stay and couldn't have asked for anything more."
83,19562636,9/14/2014,Simon,"Rick was a very friendly host who made our staying just perfect.<br/>We only could stay for a very short time but i will definitely go back shortly. It was really easy to get to the city center. Beautifull design in the flat and everything was clean. A must if you want to visit Amsterdam!!!"
83,19597588,9/15/2014,Igor,"Beautiful  and immaculate place! The location is perfect, right between the airport and the city center. Would highly recommend to anyone vising Amsterdam."
83,20267751,9/26/2014,Luiz,"Het was wederom een zeer prettig verblijf in Amsterdam. Een prachtige locatie om een goede nachtrust te genieten om zo de stad te bekijken, een congres te bezoeken of andere activiteiten te doen. Rick is de ideale gastheer voor een top verblijf! "
83,20331761,9/28/2014,Jd,"I had a most pleasant stay in RickÂ´s apartment. The room was bright and cheerful, with a view of the park. The bath and WC were also sparkling clean. The area is quiet and the park couldnÂ´t be handier for a stroll."
83,20435675,9/29/2014,Elizabeth,I had a lovely stay at Rick's beautiful place - he is a very kind and friendly person and his apartment is spotless. The bed was full-size and comfortable. The breakfast was generous and self-serve. I would definitely stay there again. The use of the museum card was a great perk.
83,20622759,10/2/2014,Rachel,I'd highly recommend staying with Rick!!<br/>I was picked up from the airport by Rick's friend Paul which was great and cheaper than a taxi :) and as soon as I stepped through the front door I was made to feel at home. I didn't see much of Rick but Emilia (rick's room mate) was there if I needed her for any help or advice. <br/>Thank you :) for a great time 
83,20724539,10/4/2014,Matthew,"I had a great experience in Amsterdam, and much of it is due to Rick's hospitality.  The room was clean and comfortable, and living space/breakfast all enjoyable.  Rick was very flexible and allowed me to check in much earlier than normal due to an early 8 AM arrival.  The free museum pass to all museums in the area was extremely helpful and well used.  However, it was the bike rental that truly *made* Amsterdam a unique experience for me!  I highly recommend renting the bike for trips all over town, be sure to get a quick briefing on biking etiquette and how to lock the bike securely.  The ease of being able to leave the biked locked literally anywhere in town was very convenient.  Thanks, Rick and Emilia!"
83,20799086,10/5/2014,Vigan,"The room and the apartment is very cool and comfortable. You have two tram lines and a bus line near the apartment of Rick and you are actually in a few minutes in the best parts of Amsterdam. Night bus lines are the same lines as during the day. <br/>We felt very good. Rick and his friend Emilia were very friendly and pollite. You can ask them for whatever you want about the city. After we woke up next day, we had breakfast and it we felt so free - like being home. <br/>Simply: recommandable"
83,21018880,10/9/2014,Guto,"Nice apartment, beautifully done up and great views from the big windows.  Near to the city and it's sights - it took me less than 10 minutes to reach Jordaan and the downtown by bike. I much preferred to live away not in the downtown but a bit away nearer to the Rembrandt park, better for jogging in the morning and maybe not feeling like being in a tourist trap all the time. Rick was a great host and very kind. "
83,21458321,10/18/2014,Jasmin,We have been to Amsterdam for 1 week. We really liked our stay at Rick's place. Good situated to public transport and a very nice view from the flat. We also had some nice talks with them and enjoyed every second of our stay
83,21537299,10/19/2014,Christian,"Rick war ein sehr angenehmer Gastgeber - vor allem aber auch seine Mitbewohnerin Emilia, welche mich empfangen hat. Das Zimmer war sehr schÃ¶n und sauber, ebenfalls das gesamte Apartment. Es ist nahe der Innenstadt gelegen, welche mit einem kurzen Spaziergang oder mit dem Tram erreichbar ist. <br/>Herzlichen Dank fÃ?r den angenehmen Aufenthalt!"
83,21580759,10/20/2014,J-Jacques,"Nice stay in Rick's appartment, everything is done to make you feel comfortable . very quiet  and restful place   .<br/> Beautiful  and very clean appartment , kind attentions from the host , the appartment is very easy to localize and not far from common transportation and  from the central station ."
83,21682934,10/21/2014,Lawrence,"I had a great experience in Amsterdam. I was not expecting an excellent home-cooked meal, which was perfect after my long trip. Thank you very much, Rick. "
83,22032847,10/28/2014,Felix,"It was an amazing weekend in Amsterdam.<br/>Rick is friendly and always helpful, he gave great tips to us to enjoy Amsterdam!<br/>His apartment is very clean and it is absolutely perfect for bed n breakfast.<br/>Thanks for making this great trip even better!"
83,22303314,11/3/2014,Carole,"Spiffy, clean, clean, clean. Comfortable bed. Rick and Emelia made us most welcome at their flat just off Rembrandt Park. They gave us a good verbal orientation to Amsterdam and offered their bikes for a reasonable rate each day. For breakfast they provided fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt, coffee...very nice. Initially, we thought we were off the beaten track, but grew to enjoy our walk home through the park from the trams, which take you everywhere. Our hosts made us feel comfortable and gave us privacy. We all shared one bath and a separate bathroom, but it caused no problems. We definitely recommend this apartment."
100,29437433,4/7/2015,Aileen,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay at Mel's apartment.  The apartment was very pretty and nicely decorated.  Comfortable bed, nice bathroom, and a washer.  The location was excellent.  A quiet neighborhood, but still within walking distance of some nice restaurants/bars.  A couple minutes walk from a tram stop, which gets you into the city center in about 10 minutes.  If you want to walk, it takes 30 minutes to get to the city center.<br/><br/>Mel was an amazing host.  She was so friendly and very easy to contact if we had any questions.  When we first arrived, she took the time to sit down with us and showed us maps she had and asked us if we had any questions about the city.  She was even kind enough to provide us with a little breakfast food for our stay!<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this AirBnB to anyone!"
100,29685824,4/11/2015,?¨?¢?û?î,"Excellent hospitailty! Very clean, tidy, friendly and welcomming environment. We loved the stay and highly recommend to anyone travelling to this destinataion!"
100,29961724,4/15/2015,Matt,The reservation was canceled 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
100,31247589,5/3/2015,Evanthia,Mel is extremely considerate and helpful. She sent website info to help plan my travels within Amsterdam along with detailed info to her place. There were even snacks in the fridge!<br/>Pros: the space was bright and clean. Close to the tram and in a nice neighborhood with places to eat and drink nearby. Supermarkets were close too. <br/>Cons: nothing I can think of. Mel is very accommodating so if you need anything at all just ask!
100,41447342,8/7/2015,Goodyoga,"Mel is a lovely host. Due to a mixup in our planning, we arrived a week early, but our host was kind and understanding. She made things very easy for us and we really enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam. As for the apartment, it is in great condition with plenty of space and natural light. The bed comfortable - we slept like stones. The area around the apartment is great. Not vey touristy, but there are good restaurants and pubs a few minutes away and the hustle of central A'dam is a quick 15 minutes by foot or less by tram. Lastly, Mel made us feel welcome at her home by offering some breakfast foods and coffee for the mornings. Highly recommended!! "
100,51144612,10/18/2015,Nicole,"Mel hat uns in ihrem zu Hause herzlich empfangen. Wir haben uns von Beginn weg sehr wohl gefÃ?hlt. Als Willkommensgeste hat uns Mel das FrÃ?hstÃ?ck fÃ?r den ersten Morgen in Amsterdam bereit gestellt. Die Wohnung ist super schÃ¶n und gemÃ?tlich, in ruhiger Umgebung. Und dennoch zentral gelegen.<br/>"

100,69656796,4/12/2016,Eveli,"I stayed at MelâÄôs apartment a bit less than a week. The apartment is very cute, clean and full of light. It is located in a quiet neighborhood and has good public transportation connection. Mel herself is friendly, cheerful and very helpful. Some breakfast food in the fridge and a package of stroopwafels for the guest was a very sweet touch to the whole experience. Perfect place to stay! "
100,70306577,4/17/2016,Byoungwook,"Mel was very kind host!<br/>She kindly greet me even though I arrived late!<br/>The location was very good to go many spots, such as Amsterdam central and many museums.<br/>The room was very comfortable as well.<br/>I strongly recommend to stay Mel's house!"
100,74900543,5/17/2016,Glenn,Mel was a good host. She was informative and gave good directions to her flat. Her flat was close enough to public transportation and sites to walk to or ride a bike. I would recommend her place fellow travelers. 
100,100845297,9/11/2016,Sylvia,"Mel is a wonderful host. She made us feel welcome and show us how to get around. We allowed to use her fridge and kitchen. She provide linen and nice big bed. The apartment location is perfect. Nice garden view from balcony. I found it as a nice and neat place ,the problem is we are from USA and we use to A/C at all season(lol), she doesn't have any Air Conditioner or fan and also her neighbor allowed to party till around 12am on weekend. So that noise travel inside the house pretty clear without a white noise from ac. But if you like to party, I supposed it's not going to bother you at all. "
100,102189529,9/17/2016,Ismet,"Mel is a very kind and helpful host. Her apartment was clean and sweet. If you are searching a comfortable house in a good location with nice host, you can stay at Mel's house."
100,109746268,10/23/2016,Denis,"Polite and respectable host, I was welcomed to feel almost as at home: clean, calm, clear instructions. Could walk to the center all time as I was on holidays. This place made my time relaxing, exactly what I expected!"
100,111852280,11/2/2016,Laura,Situado cerca del centro pero en un barrio tranquilo. Apartamento con bonitas vistas y una anfitriona muy amable y silenciosa.
100,133041671,2/20/2017,Jason,"Mel is a great host with a very nice apartment that is within walking distance from the main areas of Amsterdam. The guest bedroom and bathroom were clean and comfortable with no issues. Mel went out of her way to make us feel at home, staying up to welcome our late arrival, laying out snacks in the kitchen, and providing sight-seeing advice for the city. Would definitely recommend!"
100,140018834,3/27/2017,Gordon,"Fleur went out of her way to make me comfortable when I arrived, and during my stay. Quite area, with easy trams to the centre town."
100,140671894,3/31/2017,Eva Langebeck,Very nice apartment with a good balcony! Really easy to find and very good neighbor hood. Fleur was a really good host and very relaxed and easy to communicate with. We don't have anything negative to say. 
100,143276721,4/11/2017,Angela,Mel's apartment is very nice. It's really confortable and Mel is helpful and polite..the zone is good and near to the metro. I suggest this apartment! :)
100,144003502,4/14/2017,Megan,"Mel's place is the perfect size for 1-2 travellers looking to be central to public transit but in a quiet neighborhood. There are plenty of things close by, grocery store, foodhallen, shops and parks as well as the canal out the window. Mel helped with planning transit, offered ideas and maps of things to do, and even had stuff for us for breakfast the first night. We were so grateful to stay here in this beautiful place. "
100,149253679,5/3/2017,Julia,"I really enjoyed staying at this place in Amsterdam,  it is clean and charming and near the tram. The bedroom is a bit small but overall it was a very pleasant stay. "
100,149686424,5/5/2017,Alison,"I booked a very last minute stay at Mel's place and she was very helpful and accommodating. Her place is spotless and beautifully decorated, the photos don't do it justice!<br/>She provided some breakfast things which was lovely and replaced my towels half way through my stay, which was unexpected and a thoughtful touch. Her place is in a great location, with lots of cafes, restaurants and bars around but her apartment is still very quiet. It is no more than a half hour walk to most things if you like walking or there's a tram and bike hire place nearby. She respected my privacy but was also always happy to have a chat. I would definitely stay at Mel's again! "
100,152616993,5/17/2017,Nick,"Fleur was great, very personable and helpful! I would give my highest recommendation to anyone looking to stay. Thanks again for everything and for stroopwafels when we arrived! "
100,155584341,5/28/2017,Sonja,"Mels place was exactly as described. To quote ""Friends"", it was ""not only clean, it was Monica clean"". The apartment is beautiful and very functional, one gets to experience the essence of Amsterdam immediately by stepping out to the balcony. Mel made us feel very welcome with breakfast supplies and Dutch treats left on the table. She was not in Amsterdam herself at the time, but communication and getting the keys was a breeze anyway. The location is excellent if one wants to see how the locals live. Tourists stay a bit further and the location is lively but quiet. I would stay at Mels again and recommend it to everyone who enjoys things mentioned above."
100,248760978,4/1/2018,Philipp,"Our stay at Mel's apartment was all in all quite nice. The communication with Mel was great, the pictures accurate and the apartment clean. The downsides of our stay were the price and the location. Over 120âÇ¬ per night for a private room in that location is kind of ridiculous. Don't get me wrong the location is not bad. The city centre is about a 20 min walk or 5-7 min ride with the bike away. But we would probably not book it again."
100,253428554,4/14/2018,Ying,"Mel's place is nice and clean, just like the pictures shown.  Except those stairs lead to her unit were steep and small, there would be no problem unless you are bringing large and heavy luggage.  Mel made us feel welcomed, she got us some tangerines and a bag of stroopwafel.  Thanks Mel, we enjoyed our stay in your home in Amsterdam!"
100,256054050,4/22/2018,Jillian,"Stylish space, kind host, great location. Bed is comfortable and very large though the bedroom is a bit small. Not in downtown Amsterdam but very close to multiple tram stops. Quiet neighborhood with lots to walk to."
100,264973778,5/15/2018,Amelia,Loved Mel's apartment and it was a great base for exploring Amsterdam. The apartment was pretty and clean and Mel was a thoughtful and considerate host. Would happily stay there again!
100,270418365,5/29/2018,Sam,"Great apartment in a nice neighbourhood, not too far from the centre"
100,278024313,6/17/2018,Tarun,The place description and pictures are accurate. It very neat and two tram stations away from Anne frank museum. All the key attraction are within 15 mins by Public transport. A tram station is within a couple of minutes walk. The location is really good and so is Fleur. She is very considerate and kind.
100,283525203,6/30/2018,Tanya,Fleur is an absolutly amazing host. We enjoyed our stay at her lovely apartement a lot and would definitely come back any time. 
100,325013565,9/18/2018,Lisa,"Clean, handy apartment. Mel was a lovely host. Provided us with tea and coffee. Gave us helpful tips and also gave us space in her apparent.<br/>Easy to reach centre of Amsterdam by foot, 20mins. By tram or even better by bike. We hired bikes close by and kept them for our three day trip. It really is the best way to see Amsterdam."
100,333379038,10/7/2018,Shashank,"Mel's place is in a great location, easily accessible by tram and close to all major attractions. The neighborhood is very calm and serene. It was our first visit to Amsterdam and we absolutely loved her place. Room is on the smaller side, but very comfortable. Especially good neighborhood for Indian tourists craving some home food as there is a grocery shop nearby which stocks all items like Maggi, Kurkure etc :p"
100,335759448,10/13/2018,Gus,"Good communication, kind, and an easy commute into the city via bike or tram! Cant wait to get back"
100,340201600,10/23/2018,Tina,"Stay here! The location is perfect -- far enough away from the toursity central Amsterdam area to feel like you're really staying with locals, but close enough by bike, foot, or tram to get to any of the main attractions you'd want to see quite quickly. The apartment itself is so cute and comfortable, and the hospitality is unparalleled. Would absolutely stay again!"
100,344252555,11/3/2018,Sophie,"Great place, great host. I would definitely recommend it!"
100,366279183,1/2/2019,Aswin,MelâÄôs place is just a walk away from the centre of Amsterdam and a tram ride away from most of the attractions!<br/><br/>You can look forward to a warm and lovely place with a very hospitable host that you can come back to and relax after a days worth of walking around the city. <br/><br/>Thank you so much for making me and my cousinâÄôs New Year a very memorable one!
100,438286306,4/16/2019,Yuli,"Mel was very lovely and helpful. Her apartment was clean and cosy. The heating was great, the kitchen and bathroom were modern and the bed comfy. We could use her coffee and tea, and she made space for us in the fridge. We had a very relaxing stay. ItâÄôs walking distance to a couple of different tram lines so that made it easy to get every where."
100,443196459,4/25/2019,Tom,"My 6 night stay at MelâÄôs was very enjoyable. Mel was a gracious host whose apartment I had full access to. It was a nicely appointed and comfortable apartment in a quiet neighborhood away from the hectic bustle of the city. Mel let me use her refrigerator and terrace and living room, the wifi was strong, everything very clean. The bedroom was comfortable and private. Whenever I had a question about a location or how to get there, Mel was very helpful, even obtaining a ticket to the Anne Frank House for me before I arrived. This was very good service. <br/><br/>A tram stop is only a few minutes walk and the tram gets you into the old center in 10 mins.  the Centraal station in 15 mins. To walk to the Anne Frank House is about 20 mins and a nice easy walk. <br/><br/>MelâÄôs hospitality enhanced my visit to Amsterdam and I highly recommend her place."
100,454444877,5/18/2019,Silvia,"I stayes at Mel's place for 3 nights and felt really comfortable there. The room and the overall flat are clean, bright and located in an extremely quite street. The flat is few steps from a tram stop to Amsterdam Central train station, so perfect to come and go to the airport, and walking distance to the centre. <br/>Mel was communicative and helpful, with a plus for being flexible for the check-out. <br/>I woul definitely recommend to stay there and hope to come back next time in Amsterdam."
100,458674484,5/26/2019,Elisa,"Great place in a good location, very good team connections right to the center of Amsterdam. The place was clean and had everything we need to spend the night. The host is wonderful and accommodating, trying to help us what all we need :) Thanks for hosting us"
100,552330854,10/21/2019,Ian,"Wonderful host in a great area. Very walkable with good bars and restaurants nearby. Not an overly touristy location but still close to everything. Would stay here again, thanks!"
87,35845080,6/22/2015,Andrew,We stayed at this houseboat this weekend and was very happy with it!the beds were very comfortable and even with 6 of us on there it never felt too cramped.we seen the host a few times during our stay and every time she was very helpful and always made sure we had everything we needed. Breakfast was supplied for us and tea/coffee facilities with a very reasonably priced mini. Also on southern comfort you gave use of kayaks which were great. At the end of the road there is a very relaxing bar/restaurant where you can have a chilled drink and watch the waterways of Amsterdam. I would recommend this place if you would like a chilled place away from the busy streets of Amsterdam but still within 15-20 minutes walking distance to everything. Thanks for a nice stay and would return again. Many thanks Andy. 
87,36707862,6/30/2015,Luigi,"Jona Ã¨ una persona simpatica ed alla mano, tempestiva nelle comunicazioni e flessibile nell'organizzazione generale. <br/>L'annuncio Ã¨ molto preciso, anzi forse rende meno di quanto dovrebbe nel senso che sia il bagno che la cucina sono comodi e non c'Ã¨ stato nessun problema nell'usufruirne, mentre all'inizio eravamo perplessi (gruppo di 5 persone). I letti morbidissimi, unica pecca chi dorme sul letto a castello potrebbe stare un po ""stretto"". In linea generale comunque era tutto pulito ed in buono stato. Il terrazzo sul tetto della barca davvero fiabesco di sera.<br/>Il quartiere Ã¨ caratteristico, una passeggiata nel verde costeggiando il canale, con le caratteristiche house boat, mentre si osserva il panorama della cittÃ .<br/>A piedi dalla stazione centrale dista poco meno di 10 minuti.<br/>Ci siamo trovati veramente bene, piÃ? che consigliato come annuncio!"
87,37006560,7/3/2015,Lorenzo,"A real Amsterdam esperienze! BohÃ©mien, like Jona, the owner, she's a school teacher and she really takes care of you. I was there with my two boys (14 and 17) we really enjoyed! Rent bykes, in 4 minutes ride you'll be in the heart of the beatiful city "
87,37244952,7/5/2015,Therond,Jona was very nice and helpfull!<br/>The boat is ideally located : close to the centruum and in a quiet area.<br/>Highly recommanded
87,37589374,7/8/2015,Lewis,"Great location, quiet and out the way but easy to get anywhere in the city. Jona was a great host! Everything was taken care of and we had everything we needed. The boat is a great place to come and rest after a day exploring the city. We are looking forward to our next trip! "
87,37722649,7/9/2015,Andrea,"Jona was the perfect host. She was very organised and made sure we were comfortable. We loved her gorgeous houseboat, very cool way to experience Amsterdam and see another way of life. The boat was located only 10 minute walk from centraal station, which was perfect for getting to the main attractions of Amsterdam and still having a nice quiet place to come back to in the evening."
87,38291287,7/14/2015,Alex,"Jona was a very helpful and friendly host, who welcomed us aboard her houseboat. All utilities were as described- the overall impression was actually even better than anticipated due to the amount of style this boat has got. The roof works great as a terrace, sunbathing there is the real deal. I need to come back here soon."
87,39780585,7/26/2015,Harry,"Jona was a great hostess, she was very welcoming and took care of us. My friends and I wouldn't hesitate to return to the houseboat in our next visit to Amsterdam. It had surprisingly good facilities, and sitting on the roof of the boat was very pleasant. The location was perfect with a short walk to the centre and a supermarket, I would recommend this facility to anyone. I cannot stress enough how welcoming Jona was!"
87,40348190,7/30/2015,Marston,Jona was amazing. The boat was a ton of fun to stay on and in a great location. Great communication and overall stay. I highly recommend it. 
87,41536990,8/7/2015,Augustine,"We spend two days I this amazing houseboat. The pictures are not overstating how awesome and special it is. The sundeck was really nice as well, and we enjoyed kayaking on the canal. Moreover, it is litteraly 5 minutes by foot from central stations and the very center of Amsterdam."
87,43067469,8/17/2015,Arlin,The host was very welcoming and the houseboat was perfect in terms of comfort and as a place to live in.  The location was ideal for its proximity to old Amsterdam and the fun to be had while still being in a quiet and welcoming neighborhood. 
87,43491625,8/20/2015,Adrian,"Location was excellent for SAIL 2015, car parking nearby, only a short walk away. Amsterdam centre and Dam square a  comfortable walk away. Everything that was needed was available, very clean, neat and tidy. Only had two nights but really enjoyed our stay on the houseboat."
87,44924268,8/30/2015,Catrin,"ZuverlÃ?ssige Gastgeberin, Unterkunft war wie beschrieben. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefÃ?hlt, zum Weiterempfehlen."
87,45790489,9/6/2015,Mariano,"AÃºn cuando Jona nos avisÃ? que no podrÃ?a estar, la recepciÃ?n de su vecina Silvia fue perfecta. Nos puso al dÃ?a de las peculiaridades de la casa, del barrio y nos recomendÃ? montones de lugares que visitar. MÃ¡s adelante conocimos a Jona y a Daan que completaros esa informaciÃ?n con sus preferencias personales. <br/>Un experiencia curiosa con todas las comodidades de cualquier apartamento y muy cerca de la estaciÃ?n central, eje de la ciudad, en una calle con un encanto especial.<br/>"
87,46316247,9/9/2015,Gahl,The boat is situated so well and so accessible.  It is incredibly  quiet.  The rooms are clean and well maintained.  The kitchen area is modern and the self prepared breakfast is exactly what you need.  We spent a night there with three kids and it was Great!
87,46940093,9/14/2015,Rose,"The houseboat Southern Comfort was very well appointed, clean and comfortable. Both Jona and Siet were very welcoming and provided information which helped us to make the most of our trip."
87,47285076,9/17/2015,Marie,The houseboat was very clean and neat - a pleasure to stay aboard!  Jona was very helpful and pleasant.  Everything we needed was there - even had breakfast supplies available for us.  The location was convenient for walking or catching the tram.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam - just wish the weather had been better!
87,48689260,9/28/2015,Nick,"Great Houseboot, good breakfast and very helpfully and nice owner and neighbours.<br/>Thanks Jona :)"
87,48999090,9/30/2015,Ton,"Great location, nice and clean accommodation. Nice breakfast And the kids loved the top deck."
87,49293472,10/2/2015,Arjen,"Jona was zelf niet aanwezig. Maar Sietske wel. Alles volgens afspraak en keurig op tijd. Voordeel is dat de locatie vlak bij de gopedkoopste parkeergarage van Amsterdam is gelegen. Je betaald maar 15 euro per dag. Sietske had nog een sloepje geregeld (âÇ¬ 80,- extra) om vanaf de boot naar Amsterdam te varen. Het is een zeer rustige omgeving. je hebt echt geen last van de treinen."
87,50071888,10/9/2015,Julia,"I loved the pared-down elegance of Jona's beautifully renovated vintage houseboat.  This is very clean and comfortable accommodation in a great location.  My children rated it as one of the highlights of their visit to Amsterdam.  Jona was friendly, efficient and helpful."
87,50793377,10/14/2015,Delia,"We really enjoyed our vacation in the houseboat. Top location (5 min by bike to the city). The boat was perfect: clean, comfortable and stylish. We will come back asap. Thank you so much "
87,51131886,10/18/2015,Didier,"Perfect location, Nice boat.. Definitely a good rent to who wants to discover Amsterdam "
87,51514197,10/20/2015,Christiane,"Exclusive accommodation on a very well maintained boat, ideally located just minutes from the train station. Very friendly welcome and very well organized, for a too short stay. We will come back ! "
87,51581375,10/21/2015,Beata,"The boat was an awesome experience! It is a bit more expensive than other options, but stayin on a boat right close to everything, walking distance to so many great attractions, it was well worth it. <br/>The 4 of us plus our small 3 year old son stayed on the boat. Jona's friend came by and showed us everything, she was super nice and went far and beyond our expecations to make sure we had a great time. <br/>We were only there for a day and a half, but we took her advice to see various spots. Would definitely recommend to stay here. <br/>Has a full kitchen and a bathroom with shower, and has internet as well. It was an awesome experience. "
87,52215840,10/27/2015,Stuart,"Tidy boat with two large airy bedrooms with large windows, each easily take 3 (double + top bunk), both have TV. Kitchen area as you walk in with seating space for 4, although no view when seated, well-equipped including combined microwave/mini-oven. Combined shower/toilet at the rear (off kitchen) relatively roomy for a boat,  decent temperature and flow to shower. 'Lounge' at the front of boat permanently locked, used by owner. Roof accessible to sit out and watch life on the canal. Heating was effective.<br/> <br/>Feels quiet and detached from city despite 3 minutes from tram or 15 minutes from central station by foot, although some noise when trains go past. Friendly bohemian feel to the area, no generators or dogs.<br/><br/>Delightful support from host, who couldn't have been more friendly and helpful."
87,52429950,10/29/2015,Hannah,"The boat was every bit as comfortable and inviting as the pictures make out. Fully equipped kitchen with breakfast supplies, lovely rooms and a really cosy feel. Only 15 mins walk from the station in a quiet, quirky part of town away from the crowds. Jona was a fantastically helpful host from start to finish. <br/><br/>Overall, ideal stay here, and lovely ducks to greet you in the morning, too!"
87,52536674,10/30/2015,Andi,"First time living on a boat! Clever designed houseboat, basically equipped with anything we need! Sietske is so nice and warm! Hope to see you soon!"
87,53084562,11/4/2015,Jordan,"TrÃ¨s satisfait du logement atypique, qui est trÃ¨s bien situÃ©. Un accueil trÃ¨s chaleureux, c'Ã©tait parfait !"
87,53476822,11/9/2015,ÃÅrni,"Staying with Jona and Daan was an absolute delight. The boat is situated about 15 minutes walking distance from the central train station, about half an hours walk to Dam square. Hosts are really good people and go the distance in making you feel like a welcome houseguest instead of a paying customer.  I can't find words strong enough to recommend staying with them.  I'm hoping I can visit again soon."
87,53986931,11/15/2015,Ingo,Es war alle super. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefÃ?hlt. Sehr zu empfehlen.
87,55825206,12/6/2015,Verena,"Wir wurden sehr freundlich von Sietske empfangen und bekamen gute Tipps, was wir in Amsterdam mit Kleinkind unternehmen kÃ¶nnen. <br/>Das Boot war sauber, super organisiert, gut gelegen und erstaunlich ruhig. Der Aufenthalt an Bord war war fÃ?r uns in jeder Hinsicht eine tolle Erfahrung, die wir gerne jederzeit wiederholen mÃ¶chten. <br/>Unser groÃüer Dank geht nicht nur an Sietske, sondern besonders auch an Jona und Daan, die uns bei einem Problem geholfen haben. Sie waren sofort zur Stelle, haben ihr Wochenende unterbrochen, um uns zu helfen und mit uns gemeinsam nach LÃ¶sungen fÃ?r unser Problem zu suchen. Unseren grÃ¶Ãüten Respekt fÃ?r diese Freundlichkeit!<br/>Wir wÃ?rden das Boot jedem empfehlen! Eine tolle Erfahrung auf dem Wasser, nicht weit vom Zentrum Amsterdams und vom Hauptbahnhof bei flexiblen, hilfsbereiten Gastgebern, die sich um das Wohlergehen ihrer GÃ?ste bemÃ?hen. <br/>Alles Liebe und Gute fÃ?r Euch!"
87,59362009,1/10/2016,Adrien,Acceuil aussi agreable que le sejour dans logement atypique. <br/>Merci pour tout.
87,60540839,1/24/2016,Bernardo,I stayed with a friend of mine and it was an amazing experience - beds were great shower and toilet were fine and although the heater stopped working one night the duvets  kept us warm!<br/>Took out the canoes in the morning and jobs and sietske were both very helpful hosts and have recommendations for things worth doing in Amsterdam 
87,62395436,2/14/2016,Lucia,"the welcome was great , kindness and attention they granted us very pleased . we found what we expected"
87,64853966,3/8/2016,Bill,"Sietske and Jona worked with us on checking in a lot earlier than normal.  I had never used Airbnb before and they gave me all the info I needed and answered all the questions I had. <br/>Sietska checked in with us and messaged us on the App when we were out in the city.  The drink's in the fridge were a nice touch and not any more expensive than going down to the store. <br/>We are already talking about going back as soon as possible. "
87,65362165,3/13/2016,Olaf,It was such a pleasant stay. Where else can you make a bonfire right in center of one of the most lovely capitals in Europe. Thank you so much for your hospitality Jona
87,68967195,4/8/2016,Jo,We were met by Sietske who was welcoming and most helpful. Neighbourhood was great. Listing accurate. Boat clean with all amenities. Walk to station and city was doable just pity that the chilly wind kept us company on the walk. Directions and communication excellent. 
87,69443255,4/11/2016,Nancy,"I stayed three nights on the houseboat, together with my boyfriend and two friends of us. The experience was great and I would recommend this special place to everyone! Sietske, a friend of Jona, took care about us on our arrival. She was very friendly, explained us everything and gave us great advises about what to do in Amsterdam. The boat is very clean and very quiet. Just great!! :)"
87,71313130,4/24/2016,Lode,"This was my first time with airbnb and Jona was very helpful with guiding me through the booking process. We got a very warm welcome by Jona, and stayed for 2 nights. The boat was very charmful, easy accessible and in a very nice and calm neighbourhood, about 10 minutes walk from the Central Station. Jona advised us with some things to see/do and kept us informed in between. Everything to have an easy stay was provided and the boat was very clean. Definitely one of the best experiences we had in Amsterdam!"
87,73480280,5/8/2016,HervÃ©,"A very lovely place and good advices about visiting Amsterdam. An original place to stay, in a quiet area, only 10 mn from Amsterdam Centraal by walk. Thanks to Jona for this place, thanks to Sietske for welcome.<br/><br/>Un accueil trÃ¨s agrÃ©able et de bons conseils de visites de la ville d'Amsterdam. Un lieu de villÃ©giature original, dans un quartier calme, Ã  seulement 10 mn de marche de Amsterdam Centraal. Merci Jona pour cet endroit, merci Sietske pour l'accueil.<br/><br/>Herve"
87,74658972,5/16/2016,Anja Laterne,"Besser kann man in Amsterdam nicht wohnen! Es ist ruhig und trotzdem nah zu allen wichtigen Punkten in Amsterdam. Man ist unabhÃ?ngig und kann sich wie zu Hause fÃ?hlen. Bleibt lieber ein paar NÃ?chte mehr, als in ein Luxus-Hotel zu investieren!<br/>Danke Jona!"
87,77730302,6/3/2016,Riku,"Asuntolaiva oli hyvin varustettu ja majoittaja oli ystÃ?vÃ?llinen, hÃ?n otti meidÃ?t hyvin vastaan ja antoi paljon erinomaisia paikallisia vinkkejÃ?! MyÃ¶s sijainti oli erinomainen, joka paikkaan pÃ?Ã?see myÃ¶s kÃ?vellen nopeasti."
87,79683309,6/13/2016,Burak,"Jona was a great host and the houseboat southern comfort is a very comfortable boat.  Jona was kind and helpful, so was Sietske, her neighbour. We felt at home. The boat was well maintaned, clean and spacious. It was located in a quiet gracht so we could chill out just next to the canal on the deck on top of the boat and had a wonderful time. Many thanks:)))"
87,80816701,6/19/2016,Verena,"We had such a wonderful time on this beautiful, charming houseboat with many nice small details and we will definitively come back. It is located in a side gracht 10 minutes from the station and very near the centre and public transport in a beautiful, colourful post-industrial area. There was even a duckfamily living next to the boat. The boat was well maintained, clean and felt very spacious for a boat. Breakfast was just perfect. We were very warmly welcomed by Sietske, a neighbour, who explained all important details concerning the boat very well. Jona, also very nice, came by later. We were provided with very suitable ideas where to go and what to do. We still spent much time on the boat and on the rooftop when the weather was dry enough. Thank you so much! "
87,81838311,6/25/2016,Jake,"Jona was busy so her friend received and settled us in. She was very professional and polite. It was abundantly clear that Jona put a veritable effort into making the stay as comfortable as possible. Jona stands out as an host by having a binder full of local tourism information. The information focused on authentic amsterdam experiences and strayed away from the tourist traps. All the amenities were clearly labeled and instructions provided for all facilities. The houseboat was a delight to stay in, close to the city center, but also in an authentic part of town away from the hustle and bustle. We also took full use of the kayaks provided and toured the canals nearby; it was amazing. Staying here was truly a unique and comfortable experience and a great story to tell your friends about. "
87,83458348,7/3/2016,Martin,Thanks from both of us to both you and Sietske for the warm welcome and for the suggestions as to where to. We loved the market and have been eating the lovely bread we bought there for breakfast this morning back in Manchester.
87,83879052,7/4/2016,Paul,What a great way to enjoy Amsterdam!  Great location. Great accommodation. Jona was superb!
87,84321699,7/6/2016,Dane,"Terrific experience!!! The houseboat is located a bit away from the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam, but within easy walking distance...perfect for us!  Very clean. Jona was very helpful and we enjoyed talking with her. Sietske, who helps to manage the property, was very helpful in providing information about the area, and was welcoming. They both us feel at home, and it was like being a local for a few days.  <br/>     A kitchen stocked with breakfast food and a washer and dryer were a plus.  We didn't use the kayaks but if we had more time it would have been fun!  <br/>     Staying on this houseboat was a highlight of our stay.  It was so relaxing to return from a day of sightseeing to this serene area.  We stopped at a market so we could enjoy cheese, meats, olives, fruit and wine at the table on the top deck of the boat at sunset each evening. Those moments were among the most memorable of our trip. If this boat is available you should request it quickly!  "
87,85133782,7/10/2016,Michi,"Everything was great!<br/>Like home..."
19,24892986,1/3/2015,Michal,"I had a great time in Madelijn appartment. It`s quite spacious and very nice. Everything was well prepared and I felt myself welcomed. There was even a bottle of wine waiting for us. The host was very flexible with both checkin and checkout times. The communication was very smooth. <br/><br/>I also appreciated that the appartment is right on a tram, that will take you directly to the center under 10min. The kitchen is really well equipped. Best thing of all is without a doubt the view from the roof top terrace. It is magical. I will be definitely coming back. "
19,31997629,5/12/2015,Jose,"The apartment had a lot of light, very clean, instructions on the table about supermarket nearby, wifi instructions and how to turn on the stove. Bus from the airport 23 min and 1 min nearby bus stop. Very convenient. Great and healthy place for breakfast down the street, Bagel and Beans. Lot of stairs to get to the apartment, but once in a paradise. Tram very close to go to downtown. Very silent to sleep. I recommend it! "
19,46398313,9/10/2015,Robert,"This apartment is a very cool place, especially if you like being near the Vondelpark. The area is full of restaurants and services (there's even lots of organic stores nearby), and right on a tram line. There's a bistro on the ground floor of the building, so there was some noise on Saturday nights, but it didn't go late. The top-floor flat has a roomy layout and a pleasant setting, and the rooftop deck is fantastic - we went up every chance we could. The place feels very hip and has everything you'd need. It's not central to the city, but we wouldn't want to stay in central Amsterdam anyway."
19,47670348,9/21/2015,Lena,"The stay at Madelijns apartment was great. As she was on holiday her boyfriends brother brought us the keys on time, showed us the apartment and introduced us to the neighborhood- he was really lovely and helpful during our whole stay. <br/>There were ""Welcome""-chocolate and instructions on the table about the apartment and everything nearby. The supermarket and the public-transport-stations are very close and it didn't took us long to get to everything. <br/>The apartment itself is so cozy, beautiful and clean as seen in the pictures- we felt very comfortable. Even if we were a bit unlucky with the weather, when we had a chance to use the terrace it was wonderful. The view from the roof top terrace is just great. <br/>They were also very flexible with both checkin and checkout times and we were allowed to leave our luggage until the evening, which was a great help. We also had a chance to meet the host when we left, and they were really lovely. The whole time the communication was very smooth and fast. On top of that they helped us to find our way to the airport. Looking forward to the next stay there!"
19,91645495,8/6/2016,Adam,"The place looks even better than the pictures! Great place, large, comfortable and clean. I would stay here again."
64,28008890,3/16/2015,Theresia,Lisa's sister was there to welcome us. She explained everything and left her number should we have any questions. The apartment is nice and well equipped as shown in the pictures. We enjoyed our stay in Lisa's apartment and would recommend it to everyone.
64,28330471,3/22/2015,Christine,"El piso era justo como decia el anuncio muy acogedor y calido. TenÃ?a todas las cosas necesarias para hacer nuestra estancia perfecta despues de un largo dÃ?a de vueltas por la ciudad. No conocimos a Lisa personalmente pero su herama nos estaba esperando para darnos las llaves. Incluso nos dejÃ? entrar antes de la hora. El barrio era muy tranquilo, cerca de un supermercado y al lado de dos lineas de tranvia. El piso esta a solo unos 10 o 15 minutos hasta el Centraal Station. Definitivamente si vuelvo a Amsterdam volverÃ?a a ponerme en contacto con Lisa otravez. Gracias por todo!"
64,28397842,3/23/2015,Nicolas,"The apartment is very pleasant, equipped well. Located outside of the city center but the tram nÂ°17 just pass at the bottom of the apartment to take you to the central station. Completed for a stay between friends!"
64,29043613,4/3/2015,Zygimantas,"Nice and cosy appartment, good location, easy communication with airport and center, friendly and helpful hosts. <br/><br/>Zygimantas"
64,37318435,7/6/2015,Andrzej,The description of flat and surranding are 100% legit. It is very easy and fast to travel from Lisa's place to city center. No problem with getting in touch with Lisa and getting more details regarding the stay. 
64,38386742,7/15/2015,Kelsey,The apartment looks just like the photos. It was very cute and we felt right at home. Lisa was always quick to respond to any questions we had. Her sister greeted us when we arrived and gave us a detailed explanation of how everything worked. We were extremely pleased with the experience. 
64,99775970,9/5/2016,Lenka,"Lisa's appartment is beautiful, clean and in a good location.  The place is a short walk from the park that takes you by beautiful walk to the Van Gogh Museum or you can take a tram that will take you to the city centre in a few minutes. We love her place and definitely recommended."
64,100607375,9/10/2016,Tilman,"We were welcomed by Lisa's sister. She was very friendly and showed us around the apartment. Lisa's apartment is very nice and cozy, we felt like we were home.

64,145832873,4/20/2017,Sylvaine,"We had a great time in Lisa's apartment and in Amsterdam. Lisa had given us all the useful information before we arrived. <br/>Lisa's sister, Rosa, greeted us with great kindness by giving us all the information needed for the apartment and gave us tourist information as well.<br/>The apartment is really nice and the proximity to public transport and supermarket made it easy for us to stay. Everything was perfect!"
64,146530949,4/23/2017,Diara,"Very nice and clean apartment. Everything was like on photos. The location is pretty good: direct tram to the center and supermarkets nearby. The first day,  Lisa's sister welcomed us and gave information about everything. I recommend this apartment, who want a pleasant journey to Amsterdam:)"
64,147324226,4/26/2017,Benjamin,"Thank you very much Lisa, your home is very beautiful and clean, I recommend this apartment."
64,147877015,4/29/2017,Phillip,"We had a great stay at Lisa's place. It was exactly what we needed for our stay in Amsterdam. Lisa is super easy to communicate with, and very friendly as well. Would definitely stay at Lisa's again! Thank you Lisa!"
63,36582438,6/29/2015,Raquel,"Wouter's apartment was a a great choice. Wouter is a very helpful host and showed us interesting things in the neighborhood. I've been at his place with my husband and a couple of friends. The apartment was perfect for us four, very clean and cozy. Plus, the place has an incredible rooftop, we were amazed to see the city from the top. It was awesome! <br/><br/>The apartment is located in a residential area, very near to the city center. Tram station is only 2 minutes walk from his apartment and we can also walk to the city center from his place (it took us from 15 to 20 minutes to go there by walking). I think it will be hard to find another place with better ratio quality X location in Amsterdam. We all enjoyed every second of our stay. "
63,37403521,7/6/2015,Vincenzo,"We spent a wonderful weekend. Karin and Wouter are lovely and helpfull. their House beautiful, clean and full of light, you truly feel at home.The location is perfect and Well connected. <br/>Really reccomended"
63,38314215,7/14/2015,Camila,"Wouter foi extremamente gentil conosco, mesmo nÃ£o podendo nos entregar a chave do apartamento pessoalmente diante de atrasos ocorridos na minha viajem ele fez questÃ£o de deixÃ¡-la com um vizinho muito simpÃ¡tico que nos mostrou o apartamento e esclareceu todas as dÃºvidas sobre o imÃ?vel e o bairro. Tivemos um Ã?timo contato com o Wouter por telefone e por mensagens via Airbnb. O apartamento estava limpo e Ã© exatamente como as fotos e a descriÃ§Ã£o feita no site. Que terraÃ§o!!!! Aproveitamos muito o sol ali. O bairro Ã© muito bom tem muitas coisas prÃ?ximo como o Halen (um galpÃ£o com restaurantes e lojas), mercados, cafÃ©s, o centro da cidade Ã© perto e Ã© possÃ?vel chegar a ele a pÃ©, o parque tambÃ©m Ã© prÃ?ximo, ou seja muito bem localizado. Foi tudo Ã?timo!!!  Obrigada."
63,40352074,7/30/2015,Danny,"The property was as described and the pictures do the accomodation justice.  We managed to use the roof terrace when the weather allowed and it is a great place to relax after a day of shopping and sightseeing.<br/>Also as it is located in Oud West we found that it was a great place place to base ourselves.  It is a 20-25 minute walk to Dam Square and the walk has like the rest of Amsterdam plenty of bars, restaurants and shops to visit if desired.<br/>Vondelpark is nearby as well and was great when wanting to escape from sightseeing.<br/>Wouter made us feel very welcome and ensured we had everything we required to enjoy our stay.  Keeping in touch and giving us tips for local attractions (restaurants etc) gave us the option to stay local if desired.  We eat out a few times locally at De Hallen and Spaghetteria where the food was excellent in both eateries.<br/>If I came back to Amsterdam or knew anyone planning to travel to Amsterdam I would definitely recommend Wouter's property and Oud West as a base.  Amsterdam is definitely a place where I'd love to visit more!"
63,43096232,8/17/2015,Yukio,"We stayed for a weekend at Wouter and Karin's place. It was a perfect match. It would've been hard to find a better location if you like us prefer to stay were the Dutch people live and get a little away from the touristy parts of Amsterdam and yet still only be a short walk away from the center. Wouter was very helpful host and made us feel welcome. He also did a very helpful guide with the best spots in the local area which we used a lot. The Food Hallen, breakfast and coffee recommendations were spot on! "
63,46878720,9/14/2015,Igor,"Our stay in Amsterdam at Wouter and Karin's home was wonderful. They welcomed us very pleasantly and gave us a lot of useful information about the city and how to discover it.<br/>We felt ourselves at home and went visiting the city on foot, as lot of interesting spots are easily reachable this way. Even the Schipol airport isn't far away, something like 20 minutes with tram and train.<br/>The house is even better than the pictures are suggesting and the beds are very comfortable ! And we enjoyed the roof terrace, thanks to the weather !"
63,51282507,10/19/2015,Live,We had a very good stay in Amsterdam in Wouter and Karins apartment. Wouter met us and showed us the local area before we went into the apartment. We got a lot of tips and follow-up during our stay as well which we appreciated. I can deeply recommend this apartment. 
63,52843544,11/2/2015,Regi,"Excellent place to stay in Amsterdam! Wouter proved to be a great host that was there to greet us on arrival. He even went above and beyond and welcomed us with a few snacks and offered us a drink before showing us around the neighborhood. <br/><br/>The apartment was beautiful- very modern, very spacious and a great location. We were blown away by the nearby market which is a large hall filled with food vendors and a bar. On Saturday morning there is a farmers market half a block away. <br/><br/>Despite being in such a great location, the apartment was not too loud. While we didn't avail of the rooftop, it was astounding and has great potential. Highly recommend this property to groups of 3-5. "
63,58795359,1/5/2016,Rochelle,"Beautiful apartment, exactly like the pictures. The house was very clean and spacious and it was great to have both the balcony and roof terrace (perfect for NYE as there is a great view for the fireworks). Great location, very close to tram stops. Wouter was very friendly on our arrival, he had brought us breakfast foods and showed us the city via a map. We also had strong communication before the trip. Unfortunately things turned sour at the end of the trip when Wouter arrived home earlier than planned and immediately evicted us out of his home due to miscommunication and misunderstandings. Still, this is an excellent location to stay in Amsterdam, perfect for 3-4 people. "
63,61845308,2/8/2016,Isa,"Wouter was very welcoming and friendly. He was very available before and during our stay in Amsterdam. <br/>His flat is very nice and clean, and there was the same as the pictures. <br/>We spend a weekend in Amsterdam and the location of Wouter flat is perfect, very close to the city center and museum ( Van Gogh - Riskjmuseum...). <br/>Thank you very much to Wouter and his family to let us spend a weekend is his very nice flat. "
63,62543629,2/15/2016,Jose,"Muy recomendable!!<br/><br/>Wouter fue un muy buen anfitrion, nos trato de maravilla dandonos una muy buena bienvenida y respondiendo todas nuestras preguntas.<br/><br/>El apartamento esta en una zona muy buena y la casa esta como en las fotos (incluso mejor).  AdemÃ¡s el piso esta bien equipado con unas camas muy cÃ?modas.<br/><br/>No encontramos nada negativo en nuestra estancia por lo que no puedo hacer mas que recomendarlo a los proximos huÃ©spedes.<br/><br/>Un saludo!"
63,71965888,4/30/2016,Becca,"We had a lovely time staying in wouter's place. The location was great, and the apartment was beautifully designed. Wouter recommended us some good local spots too - will definitely stay again! "

63,89248165,7/27/2016,Catherine,"We had a great stay at Wooter's place in Amsterdam. The flat is spacious and light. It was perfect for our family (2 adults, 2 kids age 5 and 8). The roof terrace meant we could stay up and relax together once the kids had gone to bed. Wooter's flat is located in the best part of Amsterdam right next to De Hallen with its delicious food hall and quirky shops. And also next to the market, with lovely fresh fruit veg and breads. While we were there our favourite visits were to the science museum, renting a boat to travel around the canals and playing in the giant treetop playground in the vondel park. We loved staying in Wooters flat and thoroughly recommend it. I also really appreciated the nespresso machine!"
63,100857083,9/11/2016,Thibaut,"Appartement trÃ¨s sympa, direct d'accÃ¨s avec le tram depuis la gare. La terrasse en haut est le must pour prendre un petit verre (surtout si le temps est bon !).<br/>Wouter nous avait laissÃ© plein de recommandations et petites adresses sympathiques. <br/>Appartement Ã  booker en famille ou entre amis !"
63,105854812,10/3/2016,Tom,We had a great weekend at Wouter's place. The apartment was very clean and spacious and Wouter had left some useful information and a bottle of wine to help us enjoy our stay! If you're looking for a quiet place to stay to explore Amsterdam we can highly recommend Wouter's! <br/><br/>Tom

63,124591595,1/2/2017,Vinesh,Wouter's place is absolutely amazing and I loved every minute of my stay. The hosts are amazing and they looked after me and my friends very well.
63,142682790,4/9/2017,Pierre-Henri,"Wouter's home is absolutely perfect. <br/>A nice apartment, very clean and spacious with a nice decoration, a lovely place in a very cool neighborhood near cool places like ""The foodhallen"".<br/><br/>The roof terrace is perfect to relax and share moments with the sun in this lovely city.<br/><br/>Wouter is full of kindness, pleasant and friendly, his communication is perfect. He  share the best places to feel like home with some nice little attentions.<br/><br/>Perfect host, perfect environment. Highly reccommended!"
63,144581186,4/16/2017,Yick,"This is one of my best Amsterdam experience. The location is great. Trendy, lively and near to everything. Near to some locals hotspots too. We were usually one of the very few tourists in that area so you can imagine how much you could immerse in the dutch culture. Also if u are a fan of airbnb i guess you dont prefer anywhere too touristy and then this location works perfect for you. The hosts are incredibly friendly and you can get everything you need there! Very clean and bright! Love the rooftop too"
63,147875448,4/29/2017,Jared,Wouter was a great host and the location is amazing. Wouter provided excellent recommendations and we took advantage of all of them. We will definitely be back!
63,155288564,5/28/2017,Marc,"L'appartement de Wouter correspond trÃ¨s bien Ã  l'annonce. Un peu en dehors du centre historique, il est trÃ¨s bien placÃ© prÃ¨s du tram 17, du marchÃ©, de Halen (lieu de vie branchÃ©), de parcs et des musÃ©es. La terrasse est trÃ¨s agrÃ©able pour prendre un verre aprÃ¨s une journÃ©e bien remplie ou pour regarder paisiblement le coucher de soleil sur les toits. Wouter nous a laissÃ© des instructions trÃ¨s claires pour ouvrir et fermer l'appartement. Nous avons Ã©tÃ© enchantÃ©s de notre WE. Marie JosÃ©phine"
63,161497974,6/18/2017,Corinne,Wouter & Karen sont des hÃ´tes trÃ¨s accueillant. <br/>Leur logement est parfait avec 1 grande terrasse. SituÃ© dans 1 quartier calme d'Amsterdam et ne manquant pas de charme. <br/>1 marchÃ© tous les jours sauf le dimanche en bas du logement. Restaurants Ã  cÃ´tÃ© Ã©galement.  A 10/15 mn du centre ville.<br/>Je le recommande vivement !!!
63,170722490,7/16/2017,Kellie,Fantastic location and great home. Excellent hosts! This was an outstanding first experience 
63,177217693,8/2/2017,Barbara,"Wir verbrachten 5 Tage mit unseren zwei Kindern (12 und 14-jÃ?hrig) in Wouters und Karins Wohnung und hatten eine fantastische Zeit dort. Die Wohnung ist genau wie beschrieben und wir fÃ?hlten uns wie zu Hause. Die Kommunikation mit Wouter ist Ã?beraus freundlich und unkompliziert. Die Wohnung war tiptop fÃ?r uns bereit gestellt, alles sehr sauber und mit allen nÃ¶tigen Informationen fÃ?r unseren Aufenthalt. Die Lage ist zentral und gut mit den Ã¶ffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln erreichbar, in einem lebhaften Quartier mit Markt gleich vor dem Haus. Die Wohnung selber ist jedoch extrem ruhig. Die Wohnung ist sehr grosszÃ?gig, luftig und hell. Sie ist modern und geschmackvoll eingerichtet mit liebevollen Details. Die absolut geniale und grosse Dachterrasse macht diese Wohnung zu einem wahren Bijoux. Wir kÃ¶nnen Wouter und Karin als Gastgeber und ihre tolle Wohnung in jedem Sinn weiterempfehlen."
63,183733377,8/18/2017,Joy,"You should stay here! Wouter and Karin's home is better than photographs and descriptions. The location is stellar: steps away from Foodhallen and many other restaurants, as well as the Ten Kate market, a grocery store, the tram stop, and the fabulous Spaghetteria. Our family loved the cozy atmosphere, comfortable furniture and beds, and general light and spaciousness. Our child adored all the toys, and we all favored the roof deck. It's an easy stroll to the Vondelpark (and many other parks and playgrounds). We also walked (with a 5yo) to the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum, and into the city center. We also cycled all over town (a great way to get around). I will note that the steps are typical-Amsterdam very steep. (Our kid has been navigating stairs from a very young age, so we weren't concerned, but I imagine other parents might be.) Overall, Wouter's place is stellar. Moreover, communication was also clear and prompt and helpful, and check in was super easy. Would stay here again, in a heartbeat."
63,194650516,9/17/2017,Craig,Amazing place that really makes you feel like you're staying in real Amsterdam. Host was great and would highly recommend this place!
63,207366929,10/29/2017,Roberto,"Everything was perfect, parks and food market nearby. House really comfortable and nice design. Great location to explore the city."
63,211188969,11/12/2017,Guillaume,Even more beautiful than the pictures.<br/>Wouter & Karin are perfect host and the apartment is just wonderful.<br/>We will go back there for sure!
63,223953553,1/2/2018,Loris,L'appartement Ã©tait plus que correct et nous avons beaucoup apprÃ©ciÃ© l'accueil et les explications concernant tant le quartier que l'appartement. Je recommande cette appartement pour sa qualitÃ© ainsi que pour sa localisation . Je remercie vivement les propriÃ©taires.
63,242150924,3/11/2018,Charles,"Wonderful place close to great neighborhood full of restaurants, bars, and steps from public transport.  Only a 10 minute walk to Leidseplein square and about 15 to other popular Central Amsterdam attractions.  The apartment was very trendy and incredibly clean.  We stayed here with another couple and it was perfect.<br/><br/>The hosts are wonderful.  Communication was extremely fast and thorough.  They even had special treats waiting for us at checkin which were perfect after a long and arduous travel experience.  In short, this is what an Airbnb experience is meant to be.  We would definitely stay again!  5 stars isnâÄôt enough!"
63,249486890,4/2/2018,Sarah,"So easy to get to âÄúold townâÄù from here. You could walk (we did once), but the 17 tram is so easy and reliable. The stairs in the home are typical âÄúAmsterdamâÄù stairs.... very steep! But it adds to the magic of the home. Wouter was responsive and thoughtful, helping out with recommendations and advice. A daily market just outside (except for SundayâÄôs). Really wonderful time there."
63,260523652,5/4/2018,Jo,"everything is wonderful.Â  Wouter & Karin areÂ  friendly host. They gave me many details and informations about Amsterdam. The appartment is very spacious and comfortable,Â  make me feel like home. it was easy to checkâÄìin and check out. I have a great time in Amsterdam. I would definitely recommend this !"
63,263501075,5/12/2018,Clarissa,"The place looks exactly as pictured and is decorated with a lot of taste. It is very well located and easy to access from the airport and downtown. We strongly suggest to rent bicycles to move around. As a family, we appreciated Karine and Wouter's place: they also are a family and understand/anticipate children needs. Their activities suggestions were greatly appreciated and made our stay easier to organize."
63,267281193,5/21/2018,Anatoli,"Wouter und Karin sind einfach tolle Gastgeber! Vom Moment der Buchung an hatte Wouter uns sehr gute Tipps fÃ?r unseren Aufenthalt in der Gegend rund um das AirBnB (und ganz Amsterdam) und tolle Tipps zum Ausgehen und Essen gegeben und war sehr zuvorkommend in der Kommunikation bei der Vorbereitung der Reise. Durch die Tipps konnten wir eine uns bisher weniger bekannte Gegend der Stadt erkunden und auch mal Trubel der Innenstadt entfliehen.<br/><br/>Die Wohnung ist sehr schÃ¶n und verteilt sich auf zwei Stockwerke und hat eine Dachterrasse mit einer schÃ¶nen Aussicht auf Amsterdam. Die Gegend (Oud West Amsterdam) ist ruhig, aber dennoch sehr zentral, fÃ?r uns war es ein perfekter Ausgangspunkt! Rund um die Wohnung gibt es zahlreiche MÃ¶glichkeiten zum Essen, Trinken, Shoppen und Spazieren.<br/><br/>Alles in allem eine sehr angenehme AirBnB-Erfahrung!"
63,280806900,6/24/2018,Davide,"Really nice clean and modern place, close to pretty much everything. Nice welcome."
63,301381380,8/4/2018,Normand,Very well located apartment/house. Just need a bicycle and Amsterdam is yours to see. Good food everywhere around. We had a great time there. Wouter and Karin where very attentionnate to make us feel welcome.
63,310850211,8/20/2018,Aitor,Wouter is a greate owner with Many recommendations giving to you in advance. You will really feel Amsterdam in his house. Te apartament is Close to many interesting places and easy to move by bycicle or by team . If you like running voldenpark is just 5 minutes running from his house. 
63,339327339,10/21/2018,Autumn,"Wouter's home was the perfect accommodation for our weekend in Amsterdam. We walked everywhere, but there is a tram stop right outside their home. So many good breakfast places around, i recommend the breakfast club! The home itself was truly amazing. so clean and beautiful. the rooftop terrace was stunning! My friends and I sat outside and watched the sunrise every morning. I couldn't have asked for a better weekend in Amsterdam and it is all thanks to Wouter and his family."
63,347270902,11/11/2018,Kayte,"Lovely apartment in a great location. Having De Hallen (vibey street food hall)  just a few steps away was such a treat. Also being able to walk (20-30 mins) into the centre of Amsterdam worked really well and saved having to navigate the trams. Karin and Wouter's apartment was perfect for our family, the toys/games not to mention the hanging chair provided hours of entertainment! The apartment has a lovely big open plan lounge/dining area so you're not on top of each other like you would be in a hotel room and the food items we were allowed to use was a really nice touch. I would highly recommend Karin and Wouter's home as a perfect getaway."
63,414661577,2/20/2019,Caroline,"Fabulous light apartment in a great location with much appreciated personal touches and lovely, helpful hosts. Enjoy dinner and drinks at sunset on the terrace overlooking the roof tops of Amsterdam and quiet nights in a great suburb close to markets, shops, a food hall and an easy walk to top attractions. Highly recommended as a base to explore Amsterdam."
63,441751963,4/22/2019,Vebi,"I stayed with three other people at Wouters and Karins flat. It was a great foundation for a beautiful weekend in Amsterdam. There are manny great things to do and see nearby. The centre of Amsterdam is about 4 tram-stations  away and can be reached easily by foot or with a bike.<br/><br/>The flat is a stylish, big, bright and with the biggest highlight on its roof which is the roof itself. A great view on Amsterdam and a great place to enjoy yourself.<br/><br/>We wanna thank Wouter and Karin for their hospitality and recommend his place with 10 out of 10 stars."
63,447925963,5/4/2019,Pierre,Real nice flat to spend holidays in Amsterdam with young kids. Wouter and his family prepared everything for us to enjoy our stay. The area around has all commodities. Third and fourth floor with steep stairs are part of the typical Dutch houses from city centre. The reward is the terrace that can offer relaxing moments when the weather permits being outside.
63,586018845,1/1/2020,Sean,Wonderful spot! Wouter and Karin were lovely hosts âÄî couldnâÄôt have asked for a better home base in Amsterdam.

53,32431153,5/17/2015,Amanda,"Linda provided a cozy apartment, just as promised. The bed was great, and she even left us with chocolate and beer, which was very thoughtful. A perfect place to stay for two quick nights in Amsterdam. Good location, we were able to walk everywhere, and take the tram when we didn't want to walk. "
53,44238860,8/24/2015,NawaÃ«l,"Linda's apartment is good and cosy as described.<br/>We had a great time and Linda was very nice and helpful when we talked by emails.<br/>The apartment is located just near the tramway and that's a great point if you need to use public transport to visit the city or if you want to go out. "
53,46782808,9/13/2015,Camille,"L'appartement de Linda est bien situÃ© dans Amsterdam, juste Ã  cÃ´tÃ© d'un arrÃªt de tram, et Ã  proximitÃ© de toutes les commoditÃ©s nÃ©cessaires. Linda nous a donnÃ© toutes les informations pour se rendre jusque chez elle et pour visiter la ville, elle est trÃ¨s accueillante et serviable!<br/>La salle de bains est sommaire mais cela convenait pour une nuit.<br/>Merci pour tout."
53,58209562,1/1/2016,Annalisa,"Linda's apartment was cosy and functional, perfect for a short stay in Amsterdam. It is very well located, in a lively but peaceful area of the city, full of cafes, bars, shops and markets. The tram stop just few meters away from the building allow you to reach the city center in few minutes if you don't feel like walking (about 2Km). Linda was a perfect host, helpful and generous, welcoming us with a bottle of wine and biscuits. It was Lovely!"
53,63892898,2/28/2016,Nico,"Wir hatten eine super Zeit in Lindas Appartement,das Appartement ist in einer guten Location und auch unweit vom centrum.Nicht weit weg der Vondelpark der zum relaxen einlÃ?dt.Alles in allem eine gut gelungene Woche.Danke Linda"
53,255619730,4/21/2018,Morgan,"My boyfriend and I spent a week in LindaâÄôs apartment during our trip to Amsterdam. Between her and her brother, there was excellent communication and we felt right at home. Linda was even sweet enough to leave us a bottle of champagne and chocolates to welcome us! Perfect location next to tram stops, but still a quiet area. Linda was always there to respond to my questions during the stay quickly. 10/10 recommend!"
50,58143685,1/1/2016,David,The apartment felt like a home away from home. Really clean and spacious and situated within a nice area that was not too far from the centre of Amsterdam. Plus there was a free ferry a short walk from the apartment to take you across to Amsterdam Central. We could not have had any complaints.
50,126954665,1/15/2017,Arne,Nice place and kind owners!
50,141208933,4/2/2017,Victoria,"Elien is a perfect host. She gave us many good adressses, her home is in a quiet and residential neighbourhood, from where you can go to amsterdam city center by boat! The beds are really big and confortable. I will definitely recommend her place :)"

50,151704909,5/14/2017,Christoph,We had a lovely time in Amsterdam and Elien's apartment was perfect in many ways. It was very clean and modern but at the same time cozy and family friendly. It was easy to get to the apartment from the city centre and Elien was very helpful with everything. I can highly recommend their apartment!
50,153421771,5/21/2017,Marta,"We had a great time in Amt, the house was perfect, with large areas, a garden and beutiful decoration. It is located in a safe place and near the city center (just a 4 minute walk to the bus stop and a 15 minute bus ride to central station)! I absolutely  recommend this house! The house hosts were amazing too, super avalaible to help us! :) Everything went perfectly! :)"
50,175185255,7/28/2017,Bjarne,Fatastic place. Better than expected.<br/>Great surroundings. NDSM is a very exciting place. You must visit the PLLEK with a great view to Amsterdam and IJ.
50,178205836,8/5/2017,Klaus,"Elien bietet ein groÃües geschmackvoll eingerichtetes und liebevoll dekoriertes Reihenhaus im Norden von Amsterdam in angenehmer Nachbarschaft. Es liegt in einem ruhigen Wohngebiet, aber man ist nur ca. 15-20 Min. FuÃüweg von der (kostenlosen) FÃ?hre in die Stadtmitte von Amsterdam entfernt. Das Haus ist auch fÃ?r einen Urlaub mit Kindern gut geeignet (Spielplatz vor dem Haus), auch ein Supermarkt ist gleich um die Ecke. Es liegt auch gÃ?nstig fÃ?r Radtouren ins (nÃ¶rdliche) Amsterdamer Umland, LeihfahrrÃ?der gibt's nicht weit vom FÃ?hranleger. Ob man sich mit dem Fahrrad ins GewÃ?hl der City stÃ?rzen will, muss jeder selbst entscheiden, am besten erst mal zu FuÃü anschauen. Wir haben es auf jeden Fall genossen, nach der hektischen GroÃüstadt am Abend auf der Terasse zu relaxen.<br/>Auch der regelmÃ?ssige Kontakt mit Elien war angenehm, die SchlÃ?sselÃ?bergabe durch den netten Nachbarn hat auch gut geklappt. <br/>Vollste Empfehlung!"
50,182727999,8/15/2017,Sarah,"Excellent stay! We rented the whole house while Eilen and Franky were away and the house was exactly as described. It is really clean and you can see how much Eilen and Franky love their home; every little detail is thought of. There is a supermarket round the corner and a ferry port within a 15 minunte walk (to take the free boat to town) which is very convenient.<br/><br/>There is an excellent quirky beach restaurant called Pllek at the port that Eilen and Franky recommend. We would definitely recommend it, especially if you like vegetarian food! Once the sun went down, they even had a beach fire and you could sit around the fire with your drinks!"
50,194606853,9/17/2017,Dan,"Elien was a wonderful host and the house is an amazing, calm and relaxing space in a quiet part of town. The house is relatively easy to find, and has the bonus of being a 2min walk from an excellent supermarket, as well as 10min walk from the (free!) ferry that takes you over to central Amsterdam - which takes about 15min and runs throughout the day. The house itself is beautiful, with a cosy living space and ample dining area, and Elien has taken great care to make sure that guests have all the info and supplies that you need (including a lovely welcome basket!). Check in was flexible, which was very convenient as we were cycling into Amsterdam from Hoek van Holland - a long ride and difficult to predict an arrival time. Elien checked in with us throughout our stay to make sure we had everything we needed, which was most appreciated. We had a great stay and would definitely stay again next time we're in town! :)"
50,221379985,12/26/2017,Anne,"Very clean, comfortable house. Larger than expected."

50,266477692,5/20/2018,Mara,"Really lovely and homie place (and very big!). Spotless clean and decorated in any details, you can feel it's a happy home! Located in a residential area, not that central but well connected and easy to reach. It was actually nice to be outside the crowd you get when you walk around the centre. One of the best airbnb homes I've been so far! Thanks Elien!"
50,287312074,7/8/2018,RaphaÃ«l,"Very spacious and quiet place. With all the equipments you need for the weekend. We never met with Elien, but our exchanges have been awsome !"
50,292523258,7/18/2018,Julius,Expect great communication and hospitality from the host.  Location is great with easy access to Amsterdam (free ferry 15 min walk away).  Beautiful / modern.
50,294484643,7/22/2018,Ming,very nice host with a very cosy home. 
50,296585760,7/26/2018,Ivonne,"We enjoyed great holiday in Amsterdam with 3 little children. Elien's house is spacious, smart and trendy. She gave us a warm welcome, although she wasn't there. Well organized. She gave many useful tips and prompt answer on any question. Considering the hot weather the location near to a canal with swimming platform is perfect. The children enjoyed the playgrounds next to the door.  Recommendation, definitely!"
50,299178219,7/30/2018,Imogen,A beautiful home in a great location of Amsterdam! Would highly recommend!! 
50,313987709,8/26/2018,Nathalie,"One of my best airbnb experiences so far. Easy communication all the time, easy check-in (although we were much much later than expected), everything was well prepared for us, also the welcoming package :-)<br/>This home is so cozy and clean and we loved to spent our time there. <br/><br/>You really deserve more than 5 stars.<br/>Thank you so much for everything. "
50,323924730,9/16/2018,Rachael,"We really enjoyed our relaxing stay at Elien's. She was a great host before, during and after our stay with quick and friendly communication. Her home is spotless and stylish, with all the amenities and creature comforts you could ask for. The welcome goodies were an extra special and unexpected treat! The area is very family friendly and only a 15min walk from the hipster wharf area (you must try Pllek) and ferry to the city. Would highly recommend for anyone wanting/happy to stay out of the tourist chaos."
50,333385483,10/7/2018,Clemence,We had a fantastic stay at Elien. A stylish and cozy home perfect for 2 couples visiting the city - I have even been inspired for our own home decor. Elien was super friendly and easy to talk to. She went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.
50,341579963,10/27/2018,Eliane,"Nice family home in a quiet family friendly neighborhood. It is easy to go to the city center with the free ferry-boat. You can go from the house to the ferry dock either by foot (itâÄôs a 15 minute walk) or by bike (we found that it was the best option for us, you can rent bikes at the ferry or in the city). Elien was very mindful to make sure our stay was comfortable and that we had everything we needed."
50,344711661,11/4/2018,Ozan,Das Haus was sehr angenehm. Man fÃ?hlt sich gleich wie zu Hause. Wir waren zu fÃ?nft und jeder hatte seinen Platz. Man kommt innerhalb 20-30 Minuten ins Zentrum. die Gegend ums Haus ist sehr ruhig. vielen Dank fÃ?r die Gastfreundschaft.

TambÃ©m todos os itens bÃ¡sicos necessÃ¡rios disponÃ?veis para uso na casa. Deixamos uma gorjeta de contribuiÃ§Ã£o por usar esses itens (exemplo sal, aÃ§Ãºcar, azeite, leite, sabÃ£o, amaciante etc). Os cÃ´modos sÃ£o grandes e confortÃ¡veis. Ficamos hospedados no inverno e tem um Ã?timo aquecimento na casa. O piso tÃ©rreo Ã© aquecido. Tem muitos brinquedos na casa, meus filhos amaram!

In a calm neighborhood, 20 min walk to the ferry that gets you in the heart of Amsterdam in 10 min. Just 5 min if you rent bikes, which we highly recommend, best way to get around Amsterdam like the locals. All in all, it was the perfect base for our 5 day adventure in Amsterdam."

Abbiamo trovato la casa pulita e con tutto l'occorrente per un piacevole soggiorno. Molto gradito il barbecue in giardino. TV con un canale anche il italiano (mediaset) Posizione Buona a 10 minuti a piedi dal museo di Van Gogh, 20 dal centro. Per i piÃ? pigri il tram a 100 metri. <br/> Supermercato super rifornito a 50 metri. Wi fi in casa, bagno con vasca e doccia lavatrice ok (per noi italiani manca il bidÃ¨). Cosa negativa ma non per colpa di Jurgen il parcheggio fuori casa.  Si trova facilmente ma costa 28 euro al giorno. Ci siamo sentiti a casa. Grazie a Jurjen per la sua ospitalitÃ ."

6,184120746,8/19/2017,Bernd,We had a great time in the flat in Amsterdam. Everything was ecellent. If we had some questions Jurjen took care of it and made us suggestions. During our stay we could always reach him by phone. We really had a great time in Amterdam and we will gladly return sometime.
6,224147520,1/2/2018,Ayse,"Jurjen was a great host. We had an incident with the keys (was our fault) and he helped us immediately. The welcome package with wine, beer and sweets was also nice. He helped us to find a location for NYE. Thanks again!! The appartement was clean and was also well equipped. <br/>The location is also great. There are many restaurants and cafes etc. nearby. You can use the public transportation nearby e.g. to go further central.<br/><br/>Overall it was a great experience. Thanks Jurjen!"
6,303853442,8/8/2018,Sarah,"Truly a lovely experience. The apartment itself if beautiful, including the backyard. The neighborhood is quite nice and beautiful to walk around. With the instillation of a new metro line (#52) that lets off just a 5 minuet walk from the apartment, getting around the city is a breeze. While I never met Jurjen in person (a neighbor let us in as they were out of town) he was always very easy to communicate with and quick to respond. Staying here made our visit to Amsterdam that much more enjoyable. "
6,415219402,2/22/2019,Keith,This bright and spacious suite in Amsterdam is am excellent point from which to get to the city centre or anywhere else.

We stayed for a week and couldn't have been happier with our choice!
6,442425566,4/23/2019,Evangelia,"The house is nice with a beautiful garden just in the heart of Amsterdam. It is easy to move around walking or by using public transportation (there is a tram stop around the corner and a metro station within 400 m of the apartment). There is a supermarket just around the corner (only that it is not accepting credit or debit cards, at least not from other countries, only cash!). There is also a park in walking distance. The host is very kind and nice, answering at no time all possible questions and providing information (even in writing) for all possible needs of his guests. In total, a good choice for staying in Amsterdam."
6,445462442,4/29/2019,Yoonji,"Jurjen is a great host. His response is very prompt. We didnâÄôt meet him on checkin but he left very detailed notes and tips for our stay. <br/>The house is located in a very convenient location near tram and metro in the hip de pijp area with lots of cafes and parks.

82,102760337,9/19/2016,Victoria,"We had a wonderful trip to Amsterdam and just to add to the holiday, Ireen and her home are just as interesting as seeing the city.

The perfect location between the busy city and the mesmerising countryside in the north of Holland! "

The highlights of her apartment are the view on her balcony: right to the river, in which you can take a swim or watch houseboats. And also to mention; the two bikes. We enjoyed the rides and saved time and money while exploring Amsterdam. <br/>The neighborhood is quiet and charming. <br/>In the morning you'll maybe have a little furry guest on the balcony.<br/><br/>We would love to come back anytime. "
77,161726844,6/18/2017,Dany,My brother and I went to visit Amsterdam and we found this Airbnb great! Its a very nice place and Jan is a very nice host too. The stop bus is very close to the place and it takes about 20/25 minutes to get to the center of Amsterdam. Its also very clean and nice :)

The studio, located on the ground floor of JanÂ´s family home is equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay: your own small kitchen and bathroom. You can enter the property through the backyard door whenever you please without bothering anyone.<br/>Check in and out was very flexible and Jan always open for suggestions or questions. <br/>We enjoyed our stay very much and the only thing i would like to mention is that the ceiling really is paper thin and you hear every step of the family above. We were not bothered by it but it might be an important information for people who have trouble falling asleep."
77,175173734,7/28/2017,Benjamin,"TrÃ¨s bon logement, bien situe ... et super hÃ©bergeur avec uniquement en point nÃ©gatif, les bruits de pas des enfants au dessus de nos tÃªte sinon excellente location !"

The only small issue was that since it's a basement apartment, it seemed a little damp. Other than that, we really enjoyed having a little private place to ourselves away from all the chaotic-ness of the rest of the city."
77,190458803,9/4/2017,Marine,"Apartment in keeping with the photos, very clean and very well appointed. The host is very nice and has adapted to our arrival and departure times. We had a great stay thanks to him !"

77,254846269,4/18/2018,Sara,"We loved our time here, and it's exactly what we were looking for. 3 minute walk to the nearest tram/bus stop and about 25 minutes from Amsterdam center. It was just far enough outside of the city to be a quiet retreat, and it had everything we could have needed! Jan Jaap and his wife were wonderful hosts, I would definitely stay again."
77,256012738,4/22/2018,David,Nice host and a clean private apartment with a separate entrance near the airport. We definitely enjoyed our stay!
77,258459794,4/29/2018,Luciana,"The studio is perfect for couples with everything you need to spend few comfortable days in Amsterdam. ItâÄôs well located next to bus, tram and metro stations, but not so close to centrum: it takes 25 minutes by bus to get there, but if you are staying more than 3 days I think is worth. Jan Jaap is an excelent host and I strongly recomend his place."
77,260295781,5/4/2018,Gunn,"Professional Airbnb host with enthusiastic to help. The house is fully equipped with amenities. It located 10-15 mins away from the museum quarter by a bus.

77,264966938,5/15/2018,Giuliano,"Ottimo per il turista che vuole soggiornare ad Amsterdam per un medio/lungo periodo. Posizionato leggermente al di fuori del centro, ma ben collegato, l'alloggio vanta di una fermata del tram/bus a pochi passi.

77,276244309,6/13/2018,Paulo,"O studio Ã©  bem confortÃ¡vel e espaÃ§oso.. Todas as comodidades funcionam perfeitamente. O maior incoveniente de tudo Ã© a acÃºstica que nÃ£o Ã© boa. Pra quem tem sono leve, as crianÃ§as correndo no andar de cima, atrapalha muito. Local de fÃ¡cil acesso com o bonde parando quase na porta. Vale salientar que o Ãºltimo bonde saindo da Ã¡rea do parque Ã© por volta de uma da manhÃ£. Recomendo muitÃ?ssimo.  Jan facilita tudo tambÃ©m.  Entrada privada para o estÃºdio pelo portÃ£o dos fundos."

It's located in the South of the city, very close to public transport (metro, trams and buses), and also super close to the Amsterdamse Bos (a large park). The kitchen is very well equipped, and we particularly loved the garden, as Jan Jaap encouraged us to use it for our meals and for chilling out. The host was extremely helpful and the check-in was very smooth, even though we arrived quite late in the evening, after a delayed flight. We will certainly recommend this place to all our friends!"

77,295779345,7/24/2018,Gabriel,"Cozy, clean place. Welcoming host. Location is not central but easily accessible in transportation, and it's on the way to the airport.<br/>"
77,314868964,8/27/2018,Anahi,El departamento es muy amplio y cÃ?modo. Tiene todo lo que se necesita para pasar unos dÃ?as en ÃÅmsterdam. Los anfitriones muy cordiales y nos dieron  privacidad absoluta a pesar que viven en el mismo predio. Solo nos vimos cuando nos recibieron y nos mostraron la casa. Como detalle nos cuna y sabanas para nuestra hija (no estaba previsto en la reserva) . Lo recomiendo!
77,319671585,9/7/2018,Melisa,"Jan was a very kind host. We had no problems with the check-in, it was a nice place to stay (it looks just as the pictures) and it was easy to get to the city centre from there (by bike). We had a very nice time in Amsterdam thanks to Jan."
77,326439435,9/22/2018,Martin,"Jan was a fantastic and friendly host. His location could not be beaten for ease of access to public transport and local amenities. <br/>It was self contained with your own private entrance and is perfect for anyone attending an event at the RAI Convention Center. <br/>Thankyou Jan, I will certainly be back in the future."
77,328061076,9/25/2018,Meisan,"The place has everthing we needed-<br/>we used the heater, washing machine, clothes hangers, the water boiler and some cups/bowls/cutlery. it was a comfortable stay. the space is larger than most hotel rooms, the sofa, tables and chairs  are useful.  We had complete privacy but Jan Jaap responded swiftly whenever we had issues. Jan Jaap is nice and friendly. the place is around 30 minutes from central-getting there is easy by tram 24 near medical centre (buses run by rnet is closer but we bought the day passes so busses are excluded and only transports procided by gvb are allowed)."
77,330230727,9/30/2018,Juli,"El departamento de Jan es tal cual las imÃ¡genes. Si bien estas en su casa tenes total privacidad e independencia ha que se ingresa por la puerta trasera de la casa. el departamento se encuentra a unos 15/20 minutos del centro en tren, y hay una estaciÃ?n a solo 4 cuadras por lo tanto es muy fÃ¡cil moverse por la zona."
77,332502542,10/5/2018,Mathias,Nice private apartment with good connection to the public transport.<br/>We enjoyed our time.
77,334110539,10/8/2018,Bartley,"Jan's place is probably the best deal in Amsterdam!!!  Most places for around $100/night are a bedroom in someone's house or apartment and you share a bath.  Jan's BnB has a private entrance and is very large.  It's a studio it but could easily be a good sized one bedroom apartment.  It's a studio because there is just a piece of furniture separating the bed area which is super because it keeps the place feeling big and open.  We were quite happy with our stay.  The neighborhood is peaceful and lovely.  <br/>A few things that might be important to some of you.  Jan has little kids that run around the house and you can hear their pounding feet quite well.  It didn't bother us at all as they go to sleep early and are gone for school in the day.  Because it's a basement the drains all have pumps to move the water out (we had this in one of our homes).  Because of that the toilet can be a little clunky and require two flushes.   The bed is about a ""B minus"" (a little springy).  Not bad, but if you have back problems or are fussy about beds you might not be happy.  It was fine for us and we would happily come again.<br/>Jan is a friendly guy and it seems like he would be easy to get to know.  He was very responsive to all requests.  You won't get a better deal."
77,336378630,10/14/2018,Egne,"Good location, Aldi close for budget shopping. From airport 341 bus is 3 stops and to city with bike 30min and 20min to city centre with bus in front of house. Everything was super. Its the basement floor of house so you can hear kids footsteps in morning, I am a heavy sleeper so it didn't bother me. We were very happy with the place, everything was good and Amsterdam is best place âù?ï¸è"
77,340208104,10/23/2018,Sebastien,Studio trÃ¨s sympa pour passer quelques jours Ã  Amsterdam. La cuisine est trÃ¨s bien Ã©quipÃ©e et trÃ¨s utile. <br/>10' Ã  pied du sade Olympique. Parfait pour ceux qui font le Marathon. <br/>Un peu plus loin du centre (20' Ã  vÃ©lo ou en metro) mais ce n'est pas un souci tant il est agrÃ©able de se balader Ã  vÃ©lo Ã  Amsterdam. <br/>Acceuil trÃ¨s sympa de Jan Jaap qui se dÃ©brouille plutÃ´t trÃ¨s bien en franÃ§ais et qui est trÃ¨s disponible pour rÃ©pondre aux demandes.

En el mismo barrio tienes supermercados, cafÃ©s, restaurantes y todo muy cerca. Aunque no conocimos a Rosalie ni su familia porque estaban de viaje, nos atendiÃ? su cuÃ±ado Eric y fue muy atento y amable. Por supuesto recomendamos este alojamiento."
1,101545599,9/13/2016,Ajey,"Absolutely lovely apartment. On the ground-floor where the entrance is on to the street, very Amsterdam style. The 2 bedrooms are spacious in the basement but is very nice. The apartment and host are lovely and welcoming. Close to the tram which takes you to Rai and city centre easily. Lovely.  "
1,173196455,7/23/2017,Nathalie,"We loved the place, its location, the size, the equipment of the kitchen, the welcoming, the standard of the furniture, bathrooms.. Just for 5 singles the bedding is not the greatest as you need to share the bed with someone. Ideal for a family of 5, 2 couples and 1 single. "
1,175229916,7/28/2017,Georges,"Rosalie's place is awesome. A few stops away from downtown and the train station, with easy (but expensive) parking, close to shops and restaurants, calm, fully equipped, with great light... Would come back any day! Thanks Rosalie for sharing your place!"

49,71873027,4/29/2016,Garth,"This apt was nice and clean as well as being in an excellent location.  There weren't any small extras I have experienced in other places like shampoo, hand towel, hair dryer, maps, recommendations, pen/paper and flexible checking/out time. Bas was friendly."
49,72614473,5/3/2016,Katerina,"Bas is a great and friendly host. He met us just on time and gave us some nice advice of what to do and see in Amsterdam since it was our first visit. The place is right the same as on the pictures, cozy and private. The location can't be more central -right next to the Red Lights Street and all other sights, but at the same time, the place is very quiet during the night time to sleep. Those 3 days were just lovely. Thank you for hosting us! I would definitely recommend this place to stay in Amsterdam. "
49,73050773,5/6/2016,Marion,"L'appartement est plutÃ´t mignon, dans un trÃ¨s beau bÃ¢timent. Facile d'accÃ¨s Ã  pied depuis la gare, en plein centre.

49,73874539,5/11/2016,Sally,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
49,74726107,5/16/2016,Alessia,"We are a young couple and we have been to Bas' place four days. The house is perfect: clean, warm, very very nice and absolutely great locationed, it could not be closer to the center! And Bas,the host, is amazing: nice and available for every advice about the city!"

49,76063591,5/24/2016,Luke,"Bas was a lovely host and was very welcoming. He offered us Breakfast in the morning, but we had already made plans. The room was as advertised and in the best location possible! Would gladly use again on my next visit. "
49,76788654,5/29/2016,Sumit,"We were a little skeptical about the location a first, but honestly we couldn't have been better located for our 3-day stay in Amsterdam. This is a quite studio, in the middle of all the action. You have cafes, bars, coffee shops, restaurants, supermarket and most other attractions close. Bas was very friendly and helpful. You have to climb a few stairs to get to the studio but it  is cozy, clean, interestingly decorated with all basic amenities and a comfortable bed. The shower had hot water running and coffee and breakfast was decent."
49,77862089,6/4/2016,Irene,"It has been a great experience staying at Bas's studio. The studio is perfect, clean, well located, spacious and it has every thing you need.  The location couldn't  be better,It is right in the centre of Amsterdam, there are lots of amenities around, cafes, coffee shops, lovely markets, restaurants, bike rental stores and you can go to most of the touristic places walking or by bike easily. Bas has been a great host, he's been very nice, helpful and flexible. The studio is located at the top floor of the building, therefore there are tricky stairs with lots of steps. So take this into account if you travel with a big luggage by yourself or you have mobility problems. I spent silly loft and the views of their typical roofs of Amsterdam. I will definitely repeat this experience in Bas studio"
49,79182739,6/11/2016,Carolina,"Bas, your apartment was wonderful and we enjoyed our stay! The apartment is in the heart of a great area in Amsterdam. The apartment building was quiet after fun full days out walking. The bed is probably the comfiest bed I've slept in the 3 weeks I stayed in Europe! The view from the window was beyond the most beautiful in all my travels in Europe! Bas, thank you again for letting us stay! "
49,80279107,6/17/2016,Keyur,"The apartment is really well located, about 200 mts from Dam square. It's a nice cosy apartment enough for only 2 people. Not difficult to find at all.<br/>Bas is a really nice host and was very helpful in the lead up and also during our stay at his apartment.<br/>"
49,80845657,6/20/2016,Stefano,"nice appartment in amsterdam's center. Perfect to visit the city and come back for a lunch or a dinner before leaving again. From the central station are realy 10 minutes by walk. Small but cozy has, more or less, all you need to live the house trying to save some money avoiding to eat outside. The appartment is on the last floor and stairs are very steep and narrow, I travel always with a backpack and I didn't have big problems but I imagine someone with a big and heavy luggage could sweat a little."
49,85489729,7/11/2016,John,"Bas was a great friendly host who was always on hand to help us if we needed it. This was our first airbnb stay and it was a very positive experience.<br/><br/>The studio flat, up 3 flights of stairs, was spacious and very central to a variety of shops and restaurants as well as a good supermarket. It was also very quiet. <br/><br/>Thankyou again Bas for helping make our stay a very enjoyable one."
49,85979594,7/14/2016,Christen,Bas was amazing! His place is perfect for a couple and walking distance to everything you want to see.in Amsterdam. He graciously answered all of.our questions and provided tea/coffee in the morning. As our flight was late on the day of checkout he also allowed us to leave our bags so.we could enjoy the day without bags. <br/><br/>In summation Bas is a warm friendly host with a lovely studio in the heart of it all. I highly recommend him and his place.

86,58820815,1/5/2016,Luana,"Naomi was really nice with us! she helped us with the night transports for the New Year Eve. <br/>the house is nice, cleaned and tidy. it's fully furnished and 2 minutes far from the tram stop. it takes about 15 minutes to go to Central Station. So it's very easy. in 3 minutes walking you can go to two groceries, a bakery,a butcher, a chemist, a flower shop and lots more.<br/>I will definetly recommend Naomi's apartments to live temporary in Amsterdam."

86,284770520,7/2/2018,Olga,"This place is amazing! It is in a safe quite neighbourhood, where you can find some nice restaurants during 10-15 min walk. The big supermarket is just downstairs, and tram stop located 1-2 min from the building. The trams go to the city center every couple of minutes (3-10 min), and it is around 15 min trip. Night communication is also available. <br/>The apartment was great, very clean, freshly made bed. Everything we needed was there, from the hair dryer to coffee press. I can recommend staying in this apartment to everybody!<br/>Communication with the host was also excellent, quick responds and detailed instructions were given.<br/>Thank you Naomi!"
86,470610344,6/16/2019,Juliana,"The apartment is very easy to get to from Centraal Station with supermarkets, pharmacy, bakery and more right around the corner. I really enjoyed leaving the city center after a full day of activities to go back to a quiet neighborhood. Highly recommend this place!"

25,52377847,10/28/2015,Linda,"   Lynette was a gracious and accommodating host.  She does not live in the loft, so we had the loft to ourselves. We had her phone number in case we needed anything.<br/>     The loft was neat and clean.  We liked the contemporary design and dÃ©cor.  It suited us perfectly.  When we return to Amsterdam, we hope to stay in LynetteâÄôs very comfortable loft."

There is so much to do there: bars, restaurants and all kind of shops. If you want it touristy you can easily catch a tram just a few meters from the building or rent a bike nearby. It takes less then 5 minutes. Both were super kind and uncomplicated. They gave us a lot of tips what to do. Thanks again and see you two next time."
21,61916502,2/9/2016,Sarah,"Leonie`s apartment was gorgeous! Very clean and comfy we immediately felt at home. The neighborhood was perfect to discover Amsterdam.

Many shops, cafes, restaurants of all nationalities waiting for you. <br/>Leonie left us a list of recommendations where to find good food, drinks or cultural stuff.

52,60735242,1/26/2016,Cem,"We really loved Ibrahim's place. Its located in the very nice part of the center of Amsterdam. Waterlooplein was just 8 min walk away. Apartment was clean and as stated in the descriptions. He has given us some useful tips for the city and even went extra miles to help us rebook our flights as the call center agents were speaking only in Dutch. He has a very well decorated apartment with comfortable double bed. Living room and kitchen was well equipped and cozy. All the museums are on the same canal front starting with the Tropical Museum being next to the apartment, we walked towards Van Gogh museum in about 10-15 min from the apartment. I strongly recommend his apartment. "

52,64843928,3/8/2016,Mila,"We really  enjoyed  staying  at the Ibrahim's apartment. We were  late  due to our flight  delay,  but there were  no problem  with  chek in. Our host  met us at night  and showed  everything  in the aparment. There are plenty  of cooking utensils if  you  like  to prepare  anything. Cozy and comfortable  appartment in lovely neighborhood  and close to the zoo and museums. 15 minutes  by bike  to the center makes  you  feel  like locals :) There is also a small terrace with chairs and table, though  we couldn't use it, because it was a bit chilly outside. Thank  you  Ibrahim! It was great  experiences  in Amsterdam )"
52,70289144,4/17/2016,Ekaterina,"We really enjoyed our stay at Ibrahim's place. It's located in a beatiful area, 20-30min by feet from the center or 15min by transport. But a walk is much better. The flat is good for two persons. It's nicely furnished, very light and clean. Views from windows from both sides of the flat are amazing. It was a pleasure to wake up here and return in the evening for a glass of wine and good music. Ibrahim was very kind and helpful during all time. So we highly recommend to spend some time here.<br/>By the way, Louie Louie cafe/bar 1min from the apt is great for coffee or anything else"
52,74649030,5/16/2016,Max-Olivier,Tout le confort dans ce superbe appartement contemporain dans un quartier trÃ¨s calme avec commoditÃ©s proches. A 20 minutes du centre ville par tram. Et s'il y avait 2 vÃ©los Ã  disposition pour se dÃ©placer cela sera parfait. A recommander ++
52,83793270,7/4/2016,Anton,"Unfortunately we did not meet with Ibrahim in person, but the communication prior and during my stay was incredible. The apartment was really amazing and the neighborhood is quiet and not that touristy, but very close to the city center. Thanks for an amazing stay, Ibrahim!"
52,124535411,1/2/2017,Fatima,"Out of the 3 times I've been to Amsterdam, this was the best!<br/><br/>Ibrahim was the most perfect host!"
52,146511725,4/23/2017,Hugo,"Just amazing apartment, just beautiful inside.<br/>We come back in the future "
52,153455059,5/21/2017,Calum,"Ibrahim's place was very clean and neat. We really enjoyed staying there, and it was easy to get into town with a tram line at the end of the road. We hired bikes which made it quick as well. The area is lovely and we enjoyed exploring slightly outside of the city centre as well. Ibrahim was a fantastic host and could not speak more highly of him, he was on hand throughout the trip and offered excellent advice and aid when necessary. "
52,195655834,9/20/2017,Bill,"Perfectly located in Amsterdam's hip, booming Oost neighborhood, Ibrahim's comfy apartment is a perfect alternative to a hotel during your Amsterdam stay. It is close to public transportation, and a short walk to Centraal and all the sights. Amsterdam's famous Artis Park Zoo is just around the corner. A huge treat is the nearby Dappermarkt with over 250 stalls serving up culturally diverse food, clothes and gifts. Trendy bars and restaurants are right around the corner. The apartment is clean, comfy and we'll equipped. Large windows front and rear fill the rooms with soft light and fresh air. The bed is welcoming after a long day exploring Amsterdam. An inviting sofa and big screen TV are great for when you want to stay in and relax. I lived my stay and am certain you will too."
36,101433138,9/13/2016,Andy,"A really comfy stay. Living room with big white sofa to stretch out on or cosy up with your loved one on the snuggle couch.<br/>Bedroom and bathroom in the basement, lovely and cool in the hot weather. Nice shower.<br/>Everything you need in the kitchen but we went out to eat.<br/>Nice outdoor area for relaxing but also very near to Vondelpark. The park is well worth a visit for those who picnic or like a stroll.<br/>Very close to some museums and a few nice local restaurants/cafes in the streets around the accommodation.<br/>Trams close by but we walked everywhere.<br/>Inge is a very pleasant lady to deal with, great communication beforehand and did everything to ensure our stay was trouble free.<br/>We would consider staying again when in Amsterdam."
36,104032199,9/25/2016,Ali,"We had a wonderful stay at Inge's place. And Inge is a wonderful person and assisted us on everything. <br/><br/>That place is located in a posh and quiet area near the Stedelijk museum (a must see), supermarket and restaurants. It is also near all the fancy shops (big brands) for those who like to shop. Not to forget that it's also close to the Vondelpark. Transportation is as well within a minute walk (tram to center). <br/><br/>The apartment is nice and comfortable. Inge has large couches. You only need to share the kitchen together which we didn't mind. Inge travels a lot for work, but even when she was present, she didn't bother us at all. We felt at home. There is also a nice terrace in back to relax on a sunny day. <br/><br/>We would definitely recommend it. "

68,67925838,4/1/2016,Michael," A clean and cozy apartment with everything we needed, in an older house with a typical steep staircase. Made us feel a bit like Amsterdamers for 1 week. Away from the crowded city in a calm residential quarter but with perfect access to the center by Metro, Tram, Bus, by a pleasant 30 min walk along the riverside of the Amstel - or by bike wich we rented nearby. Two shopping areas around the corner even with biological food. And it all started with a warm welcome in the midst of the night from our kind host Pauline, super-friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone."
68,69125464,4/9/2016,Tasnia,"Pauline was extremely welcoming and quick to respond to our messages.

68,91537587,8/5/2016,Aleksandra,"Me and my husband have just came back from our honeymoon in Amsterdam. It was a fantastic time for us and one more reason for it is that we stayed at Pauline's apartment. <br/>Pauline is a wonderful host, she was very polite and gave us all the necessary information in detail. She also congratulated us with our wedding and that was very sweet and pleasant for us. <br/>The apartment is well-located close to the metro and tram station and there is a good supermarket just around the corner.

The apartment is neat and tidy, I especially love the kitchen!! <br/>Pauline and her friend are always assessable for enquiry or help. ItâÄôs also so kind that she left us with some tourist information even though we didnâÄôt meet her during the stay. We had a wonderful time in NL!"

12,70494697,4/18/2016,Vicky,"Myrthe was a fantastic host even before the trip had started. Upon booking we received a very useful guide with tourist information and restaurant recommendations. Upon arriving we received a lovely hamper with a bottle of bubbly, juices, fresh fruit and a map. The studio flat was lovely for two people and was very clean. Before leaving us Myrthe told us we were more than welcome to use anything in the apartment and to help ourselves to anything in the fridge. I was very impressed that she also went above and beyond what is usually expected and had the bathroom fully stocked with toiletries. The apartment is in a nice quiet part of Amsterdam with everything in walking distance. I would definitely recommend staying here!!"
12,72466837,5/2/2016,Julie,"What a wonderful weekend! The flat was lovely and airy, very clean and just what we needed.  The photos don't really do it justice. It is near to lots of stuff but far enough away to be quiet in the evenings and very close to buses and trams as well.  Myrthe was very helpful with lots of local info and left us with a nice welcome! Nice comfortable bed and a good shower.  This may have been a once in a life time trip for us, but if we ever get another chance to go back, I would definitely go back to Myrthe's lovely flat. "

We met the lovely Myrthe for a drink before we went to the apartment and we had a good old chat about each other and about Amsterdam itself. <br/>We were then shown to the fabulous retro chic apartment. The photos do not do this place justice! Beautifully laid out with a fabulous wet room and cute little balcony.. And right across the road from a fantastic little bar!<br/>We had everything we could possibly need including drinks and snacks and a bottle of prosecco to really get the weekend going! We were given a pack that told us all about the area and given the wifi password so we could upload our snaps and keep in touch with people from home. <br/>I can't recommend this apartment more! If you're looking for somewhere away from noise of 24 hour Amsterdam but only 15 minutes from the centre (less than 5 minutes on the bus) then this is the place for you! You'll be looked after and your host is only a text message away!<br/>Huge thanks to Myrthe for a fabulous weekend away! We will definitely be back!! <br/>Big love from the ""couple""<br/>See you next year and you must come to the parade with us :-D<br/>"

She gave us great info on what to do in the area and even had a guide put together for restaurants, bars, and things to do.<br/><br/>The apartment itself was great!  Very nice, clean, and well decorated.  It was located right next to the Joordan area and is extremely convenient to get around.  We were able to walk everywhere during our stay.  It's also a 5-minute walk to the bus/tram stop.  We used this on our last day to quickly get a bus to Amsterdam Central Station where we could get a train to the airport.  You could also use this bus/tram stop to get around the city if you were tired for walking.<br/><br/>The apartment was a quick walk to restaurants, bars, and cafes.  There's a great restaurant/bar right down the street from the apartment which had wonderful local craft beer and great food!<br/><br/>It was really a great place to stay and was perfect for our trip!"

She was easy to communicate with prior to our visit and even arranged for us to leave our luggage with a neighbor/friend so that we didn't have to carry it around all day. She met us promptly at check in time (5 minutes early). Welcomed us with a bottle of Sparkling wine and then took is out for drinks at an awesome cafe/pub right around the corner. <br/>The apartment was really comfortable, huge sectional couch that was great to come back to and sink in after long days of walking the city. Mrythe provided us with a detailed guidebook so we could easily locate everything we were interested in doing. <br/>The kitchen seemed very well equipped, and we had planned to cook, but ended up eating out as everything was so convenient. <br/>The Jordaan area is great, I highly recommend staying here."

Son appartement est trÃ¨s joli (encore mieux que sur les photos) et trÃ¨s propre ! <br/>Souriante, chaleureuse, attentive, Myrthe a fait en sorte que nous passions un excellent sÃ©jour : c'est trÃ¨s rare de rencontrer une personne et une hÃ´te comme elle !<br/>RÃ©servez les yeux fermÃ©s !"
12,168259306,7/9/2017,Kaylah,"Absolutely loved staying here. It was an easy walk to the main town and so close to cute restaurants and places to drink. The place was clean, tidy and very homely. Myrthe was amazing too as she gave us so much information about things we could do and places to go for dinner/drinks. Would highly recommend this place. "
12,171614328,7/18/2017,Joel,"This was a fantastic start to our trip. Myrthe was an amazing host - went out of her way to ensure we were welcomed by her personally, and provided us with a comprehensive booklet with tips for every aspect of the city (where to eat, where to go, how to get around). The apartment was clean and comfortable, and the kitchen was equipped for us to cook. The area is safe and quiet, but close to public transport (2 min walk to bus/tram stops that go all over the city). Also within walking distance to the Jordaan area with stores, restaurants, etc. Would highly recommend!"
12,175861929,7/30/2017,Nicolas,"Nous avons adorÃ© l'appartement de Myrthe, trÃ¨s accueillant, propre et Ã  la dÃ©co soignÃ©e.<br/>L'appartement est dans un quartier trÃ¨s calme, trÃ¨s joli (comme beaucoup d'endroits Ã  Amsterdam) et pas loin du quartier trÃ¨s agrÃ©able de Jordaan. Il y a pas loin quelques lignes de bus trÃ¨s pratiques dont la frÃ©quence de passage est toutes les 5 Ã  10mn en moyenne.<br/>Myrthe nous a reÃ§us en nous invitant Ã  boire un verre Ã  cÃ´tÃ© de chez elle et la conversation a Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s sympa. Elle avait en plus fait un effort pour nous recevoir plus tÃ´t que prÃ©vu. On a beaucoup apprÃ©ciÃ© sa disponibilitÃ©, elle est Ã  recommander sans rÃ©serve !<br/>Mon meilleur sÃ©jour Airbnb Ã  ce jour."

She met us at check-in for a drink, gave us a bunch of great recommendations of what to do during our stay, many of which we took her up on and regretted none. The apartment is great and almost felt like we were in a hotel. While not right in the central area, still very walkable to everything. We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend!"
12,182368484,8/14/2017,Mike,"Myrthe's apartment is even nicer than the pictures, in an extremely cozy neighborhood conveniently located for cafes, restaurants and public transportation.

12,222194465,12/29/2017,Jean-Marc,"Excellent accueil par son ami Gino Ã  notre arrivÃ©e chez Myrthe, qui Ã©tait en voyage. LâÄôappartement est petit mais trÃ¨s bien agencÃ©, confortable et parfait pour un court sÃ©jour Ã  Amsterdam : il est trÃ¨s bien situÃ© juste au-delÃ  de Jordaan. Le tram est Ã©galement Ã  quelques pas, ce qui est bien pratique si la mÃ©tÃ©o est mauvaise.<br/>Enfin le quartier est trÃ¨s calme. Il faut appliquer la rÃ¨gle qui semble gÃ©nÃ©rale de faire attention au bruit, y compris dans la rue (penser aux valises roulantes extrÃªmement bruyantes)."
12,263549428,5/12/2018,Yvonne,Myrthe ist DIE perfekte gastgeberin! <br/>man kann ihr jederzeit und wegen allem schreiben & sie gibt die besten tips!<br/>wir kommen auf jeden fall wieder & nehmen ihr appartment in anspruch

12,286075652,7/5/2018,Lesley,"MyrtheâÄôs apartment was absolutely perfect! My husband and I spent our first anniversary in Amsterdam and we could not have asked for better accommodations. Myrthe was very quick to respond to messages, her apartment is in a great location, and she even met us at the bus stop upon our arrival! Her apartment is in a quiet neighborhood thatâÄôs easily within walking distance to the city center, museums, and great restaurants. Myrthe created a listing of recommendations that we found to be very helpful. We ended up spending most of our time in the Jordaan neighborhood based on her suggestions. I would absolutely recommend her apartment!!"
12,288252298,7/9/2018,Matthew,"We canâÄôt say enough positive things about our stay at MyrtheâÄôs apartment! It is located on a quiet street just a short walk from the Jordaan are. ThereâÄôs a local bar across the street and a park around the corner. Bus and tram stations are close by. It was very easy to get to from the train station and MyrtheâÄôs directions were excellent. <br/><br/>Upon our arrival, Myrthe met us at Broer, the cafe/bar near the place, and welcomed us with some beers. Meeting her was one of the highlights of our trip!  She was so fun to talk with and it was a great was to learn about the city from a local. Later, she emailed us a document with all of her recommendations for Amsterdam, and many suggestions based on what we talked about at the bar! <br/><br/>The apartment itself was perfect - quiet, clean, and comfortable. Very spacious, too. We loved having space to spread out. There is a washing machine, should you need it. And as if buying us drinks wasnâÄôt enough, Myrthe left us a bottle of sparkling wine to welcome us to Amsterdam and offered up all of the drinks in the fridge. Before she left, Myrthe made it clear that we were more than welcome to message her should we need anything else during our stay. <br/><br/>Absolutely unforgettable stay thanks for Myrthe. We hope to return to Amsterdam and stay again!"
12,291591373,7/16/2018,Adam,My Wife and I stayed in MyrtheâÄôs place for 4 days and we had such a great time! Myrthe is very kind and her place is in a great location.

12,321484639,9/10/2018,Kelly,"My husband and I stayed at Myrthe's place for 7 days and enjoyed every expected and unexpected  amenity.  Myrthe was detailed and thorough with her accommodation description and directions to her place.  She was in contact with us to be sure our arrival went as planned, we were comfortable and all our needs were provided.  Myrthe's fully furnished apartment was clean and the balcony was a nice touch.  The bed and couches were very comfortable. The neighbors and surrounding neighborhoods were quiet and also welcoming in passing.  The location of Mrythe's place worked great for us. The bus and tram were within 2 blocks of her place, the markets were within walking distance and plenty of cafe's and restaurants nearby.  Mrythe went above and beyond to assist us with navigating our way around Amsterdam and the surrounding area, as well as assisting us in getting to Brugge by Train.  For our first trip to Amasterdam we found Mrythe to be an amazing host and guide.  I would recommend Myrthes place to any of my family or friends!  Thank you Myrthe!"

Myrthe is an exceptional host, catering to our needs with all the necessary amenities one needs for a comfortable stay.

12,401351346,1/14/2019,Halley,"Myrthe was lovely and so was her place! She took us out for a drink upon our arrival and told us about all the spots! She made a guide for us with all the things to do and see. Her place was conveniently located, cute and clean. I would stay there again in a heartbeat."
12,435377219,4/10/2019,Dietmar,"The landlady makes every effort to make you feel comfortable in Amsterdam. She even wrote a little guide, which she hands out on request. The best tips are included to make city life as close as possible. In the apartment there is nothing missing. It's like in the description. Public transport is nearby. So you I can highly recommend this place to all travelers. Thank you for such beautiful days!"
12,441670019,4/22/2019,Anja,"We had an amazing time at MyrtheâÄòs place. The apartment was clean and near to the city center. Myrthe was the best host we could imagine. Easy communication all over the time. We can highly recommend this Airbnb! Thanks for all, Myrthe! :-)"
12,447882338,5/4/2019,Carolyn & Brent,"My partner and I arrived early and the SuperHost was able to accommodate us. We really appreciated the extra attention after a 9 hour flight with a total travel time of 14 hours that day. <br/>The location of the apartment is fantastic. There is a very nice cafe around the corner and lots of other eating establishments within walking distance. It's a short walk to several public transportation options. <br/>The host's suggestions for things to do and see was very helpful. I think we hit almost every item on the list. <br/>When we were not out exploring, the apartment felt homey and very comfortable. We did not use the kitchen, but it appeared to be stocked with all the necessities. The bathroom was clean and spacious. The living room was comfortable. There is an amazing amount of natural light coming in through huge windows. It was cold during our visit, so we did not sit on the patio, but it has a nice view over the neighboring gardens. <br/>We really enjoyed our first visit to Amsterdam and definitely recommend staying at this apartment."
92,63309829,2/21/2016,Enes,It was a nice place to stay. They welcomed me warmly and even offered me bread and tea. Room and other places were nice and clean.
92,64946703,3/9/2016,Kees,"Great location close to de pijp, which has lots of little bars/restaurants/shops and feels much more authentic than the center. Super friendly welcome, the host is very accomodating and supportive regarding my schedule (checkin, etc.). The room was clean, everything was there, and I felt very comfortable. All in all a highly positive experience."
92,65094501,3/10/2016,Monique,"This is a great place to stay. As described it is a small cozy room, the key word being cozy. Nasrien made sure I really felt comfortable and at home. From the minute I walked in. It was clear to me that she just wanted to make sure I had a great, comfortable and restful time. The apartment was super clean and anything I required was available. As I had travelled for work purposes, she was happy to show me where I had to go. The apartment is conveniently located close to Amsterdam RAI and so is easily reachable from the city and the airport which was perfect for me. <br/>Nasrien is a great host. as a single young traveller it can get slightly overwhelming and lonely but Nasrien was available for any questions and general chit chat.<br/>I would recommend staying here and would be happy to stay again."
92,65271063,3/12/2016,Pablo,"Nasrien is a great host, she will become your friend in Amsterdam for sure, Kind and sweet person, easy going with a busy life but still time to have a chat with you.<br/>The area is great easy to get in to central Amsterdam and has restaurants, groceries stores, gym etc etc.... whatever you need is around there."
92,65910424,3/17/2016,Silvia,Very friendly and flexible host (very late arrival). I have really felt at home with her and her lovely daughters. I hope we'll see each other soon!

92,68419035,4/4/2016,Stephanie,"Nasrien was a very kind and thoughtful host, and makes an excellent coffee! It is a lovely, warm family home, providing a little taste of dutch life. I wish I stayed a little longer..!"
92,69319188,4/10/2016,Norihito,"She has really nice hospitality.<br/>Very quiet place, 20min tram ride to city center.<br/>It was nice stay."
92,69961367,4/15/2016,Georg,Everything went very fine. Cozy small room. Thanks!
92,70248813,4/17/2016,Ann,"Nasrien was the warmest, most welcoming hostess who could be imagined, and her 9-year old daughter is lovely.  Their home is comfortable and my room was spotless.  <br/>I just joined in the home life in the evenings, and was made to feel almost one of the family.  If/when I go back to Amsterdam I hope to stay with them again."
92,70780481,4/20/2016,Duarte,"Staying at Nasrien's place was great. She and her daughter made me feel welcomed, the room was delightful, and the neiborghood was very easy to access. I highly recommend it. Thank you Nasrien!"

92,73099457,5/6/2016,Tony,"Nasrien was very welcoming--offering tea and coffee and conversation right away. The room is as advertised, near both a tram and not far from a subway (took me about 20 minutes to get to the city center). It's very quiet at night--easy to sleep. <br/>She was very kind and open--I had a nice stay here. "
92,74284353,5/14/2016,Paloma,The room is exactly as described; it is cozy and comfortable to rest. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. Nasrien is a very welcoming host. 
92,74640461,5/16/2016,Linh,"Nasrien was very warm and welcoming, offering me tea, coffee, and water when I arrived. She also left a cute little souvenir on my bed to remind me of Amsterdam, which was sweet.<br/><br/>The room is as she advertises - cozy and small. Unfortunately, it was after I booked when the conditions for breakfast changed - available only upon request - and I didn't realize until the second day when I re-checked the ad. Because Nasrien was stressed about her new dog though, I didn't want to add extra pressure by asking for breakfast, but it would have been nice to have a banana or something small before I started my day.<br/><br/>Please note that the toilet is on one floor and the washroom sink is on another - a minor inconvenience, but luckily I carry around a bottle of sanitizer in my purse.<br/><br/>Also note that the flat is marked as ""smoking not allowed"", but I smelled cigarettes during both nights I was there. I was unsure whether the smoke was coming from within the flat, but perhaps confirm this with Nasrien if this would be an issue for you. I kept the bedroom door closed at all times so none of my belongings smelled like smoke after I left.<br/><br/>All in all, the room suited my purposes, which was to be a place to sleep at night. The room itself faces onto a back garden so there were no noises to intrude on a good sleep. Nasrien was nice and helped with directions on how to get to the city where I was meeting friends. If I timed it right, it took me just over half an hour to get to Centraal Station, door-to-door.<br/><br/>If you know what to expect from this place, this is a better option than staying in one of the city's numerous, over-priced hostels where you have to share a room with strangers. "
92,76172735,5/25/2016,Gong,"Hi,Nasrien, thanks very much for the very warmly host!<br/>"
92,77244063,5/30/2016,Bee,"Nasrien was a great host and I had a wonderful first-time experience in Amsterdam, as well as using Airbnb! Nasrien provided a very detailed information on how to get to her place before my travel. She immediately made me feel warm and welcomed when I arrived. Her place and the room listed were spotless! The location of her place is great too - with shops around and great transport links. It is also a very quiet area so you get nice sleeps!<br/><br/>Nasrien is a great host and a lovely lady, I would certainly recommend her to anyone (especially solo travellers!) who is traveling to Amsterdam."
92,77895267,6/4/2016,Carlos,"She was really nice all the time and provided a nice and relaxed conversation. Because she had quite a lot of experiences in her life she doesn't run out of stories to share. She also respecto your privacy a lot. The listing was very accurate and the neighborhood was nice, didn't have any problem. If I go back to the city I'm sure I'll try to stay with her again."
92,77952911,6/4/2016,Kun,"It is a nice room with a perfect location, only several minutes by walk to RAI. Nasrien is really friendly and she can help you what you need. I do have a good time there, strongly recommended. "
92,80307282,6/17/2016,Joanne,Nasrien's apartment was very clean and tidy. The bed is comfortable and you can sleep well throughout the night. I would say my home is not even as clean as hers! Highly recommended!
92,80997018,6/20/2016,Marty,Nasrian was a great host. The room was clean and as described. Trams are within easy walking distance. Cheers
92,82108780,6/26/2016,Evgenij,"Nice place on the south of the city, very close to RAI. It will take about 20 minutes to get to the city center by tram, or about 50 minutes of walk. The room is small, clean and comfortable. Nasrien is friendly and helpful host. She will always answer to your questions."
92,83193609,7/1/2016,Cristina,"The description is accurate, the apartment its very close to the tram stop and from there its like 10 minutes to get to the Flower market and 17 min to the Central Station.. Nasrien is friendly and bubbly, and makes you feel like home, I felt welcomed and she gave me lots of advices of what to do around during my stay.. While I was there, she was doing some improvements to her house so I guess next guests will have a even better stay than mine :) <br/>Thanks for everything Nasrien! "
92,84796351,7/9/2016,Sarah,"Comfortable room, good service and very nice host. 30mins walk from city centre. I had a great time staying at this place. "

92,89007006,7/26/2016,Dianne,The host was quite open and frank. She explained everything to me and even showed me a part of the area where she lives. Her place is well located near most attractions that you would want to see in Amsterdam. The tram and bus stops are close and it is near the airport. Nasrien listens to your plans and offers good suggestions. The neighbourhood is residential and safe with nice cafes. I would recommend staying at Nasrien's place. 
92,89837921,7/30/2016,Katrina,"Nasrien was a wonderful host and made me feel extremely welcome in her home. The room was delightful as was the entire apartment. It is in a quiet, safe area of Amsterdam which meant walking around the neighbourhood in the evening was stress free.  There are many supermarkets and restaurants and bars within a short distance it is also close to a tramstop so the centre of the city is about twenty minutes away.  The apartment is lovely and decorated tastefully. I would not recommend it if you have mobility problems as there are many stairs. "
92,93243570,8/12/2016,Tom,"Nasrien was very welcoming and helpful, and the room was adequate for my needs. The neighbourhood seems very nice (although I didn't spend all that much time there): quiet but close enough to the centre. "
92,94321174,8/15/2016,Maria,"Nasriens was a nice host. Her place was super clean and she explained a lot to me about the area and how to get to some key locations, which I appreciated. There was only about a ten to 15 minute ride on the Tram to central station. It's a good location for people that don't want to be right in the center. "
92,96287750,8/22/2016,Shaleya,"I had a good stay at Nasrien's place. It was easy to get to and in a nice quiet area. The whole place was spacious, bright, and clean. <br/><br/>Nasrien was a good host. We did not have the opportunity to chat too much during most of my stay, but I enjoyed talking with her on the first day as she gave me the tour of her apartment. She showed me everything I could need."
92,98045589,8/29/2016,Uenia,"Peut-Ãªtre une question de destinÃ©e mais, je me suis tout suite sentie Ã  l'aise ave Nasrien, en effet, j'avais l'impression de retrouver une amie de longue date et j'ai eu Ã©normÃ©ment plaisir Ã  partager ses trois jours de ma vie avec elle et sa fille.<br/>Chaleureuse, vraie, gentille, bonne conseillÃ¨re et soucieuse du bien Ãªtre de son hÃ´te, voici quelqu'unes des multiples qualitÃ©s de Nasrien. <br/>La chambre est cosy, le lit confortable et le quartier trÃ¨s calme, enfin tout ce que nous avons besoin pour nous remettre d'une grande journÃ©e de visite ou de la nuit de Amsterdam.<br/>Merci Airbnb pour nous permettre de rencontrer des personnes comme Nasrien, qui rendent nos voyages si inoubliables et spÃ©ciales.<br/>"
92,100219833,9/8/2016,Tabitha,"I had a wonderful stay with Nasrien during my three days in Amsterdam! The listing was quaint and in a quiet neighborhood a walkable distance from the city center, with lots of shops and restaurants and the Albert Cuyp Market along the way. My favorite part of the stay was hanging out with Nasrien, who is friendly but also intelligent, spunky, hilarious and a lot of fun to talk to when she's in the mood, especially since she has lived a lot of life and has a lot of stories. Definitely positively shaped my experience of Amsterdam!"
92,101259809,9/12/2016,Fabiana,"Die Unterkunft war sauber und gut mit den Ã¶ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel zu erreichen. Alles stimmte mit der Beschreibung Ã?berein. Nasrien war eine freundliche und unkomplizierte Gastgeberin,  Vielen Dank!"

92,104314301,9/26/2016,Gulay,"First of all, I haven't stayed at this place and can not say anything about the accommodation. <br/>The host wasn't able to give me the necessary information, confirm my arrival date or just answer my messages till the evening of my arrival. After the poor communication with the host I decided to stay somewhere else. Unfortunately I didn't get my money back. Overall it was a bad experience with Airbnb and the host. "
92,105470097,10/2/2016,Maria,"Nasrien was absolutely lovely, and her flat was also very nice and welcoming. It was the perfect place to come back to after a long day of exploring Amsterdam. Thank you so much!"

92,109782799,10/23/2016,Catalina,"La habitaciÃ?n es lo prometido, pequeÃ±a y agradable. El Barrio es muy tranquilo,  y se conecta fÃ¡cil con el resto de la ciudad con el Tram. La anfitriona es amable. En mi caso, en una prÃ?xima visita me alojarÃ?a un poco mÃ¡s cerca al centro."
92,111653846,11/1/2016,Richard,Nasrien is a wonderful host. Though the accessibility to the bathroom sink was a bit awkward her hospitality made up for it.

92,113077532,11/10/2016,Rafael,"I had a very pleasant stay. Nasrien and her daughter were adorable. I went to Amsterdam for a conference in RAI, which is walking distance from the flat. I had everything that I needed and I felt very welcomed."
92,113908144,11/14/2016,Lenka,"Nasrien is very nice and talkative, she was very helpful via (Hidden by Airbnb) and offered me coffee and tea. I felt that I can write her anytime and she will help me.<br/>The room is small and cozy and also cheap, so I didn't expect anything special. Everything looks like on photos and it is absolutely OK if you travel alone and you just need to oversleep somewhere. To the centre<br/>It is about 15 - 20 minut and connections are very good.<br/>What I didn't like: the room was a bit cold for me, but I got really good blanket, also the Internet connection is not the best one, it was slow."
92,114989127,11/21/2016,Daniel,"Nasrien was a great host, very friendly and easy going. The house was very clean with everything you need for a short stay. Close to the airport, public transport and easy to get to and from Amsterdam."

8,76405836,5/27/2016,Rolands,"Big thanks to Merel and Mart for hosting me. Merel approved my reservation in the last evening before my arrival and with no hesitation. The location is pretty central, for me it was perfect, as it was in 5min walking distance to RAI.<br/>The apartament is as described. It had all necessities. The bed is very comfortable. <br/>Did not personally meet Merel, but Mart was very friendly and helpful. Would stay at their place again and would recommend it to others.<br/><br/>"
8,79521140,6/13/2016,Sally Beth,"Merel and her husband are a really nice and lovely couple. The apartment was really confortable and clean, and we loved the smalls details that they have all around the house describing their adventures. They helped us to get there and we had some small chats (they have a perfect english). The bathroom was really clean also. There are 2 supermarkets within a walking distance (10min) and a bar (5min), and you can get to Amsterdam centraal in 20 by tram."
8,82284937,6/27/2016,Stijn,"We stayed just for one night with Merel and Mart to visit Amsterdam for a short citytrip. Their apartment is very beautiful and we loved the room. The bed was just great. We didn't meet Mart but Merel was a perfect host, she even offered their bikes to explore the city. <br/>Also the location is very convenient, it is close enough to the highway but the neighbourhood is very quiet and peaceful, if you walk 5min you can take a tram straight to the centre.<br/>We loved our short stay in Amsterdam!!"

8,96644045,8/23/2016,Franziska,Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt bei Merel in Amsterdam. Das Zimmer ist gemÃ?tlich und perfekt fÃ?r ein Wochenende fÃ?r zwei Personen. Merel ist eine tolle Gastgeberin. Wir durften alles nutzen und uns auch am KÃ?hlschrank bedienen. Das Haus von Merel liegt im SÃ?den der Stadt. Die Altstadt kann man mit damit Fahrrad gut erreichen.

8,114809476,11/20/2016,Alice,L'appartement est proche d'un arrÃªt de tram qui est Ã  4-5 stations du centre. Merel est trÃ¨s accueillante et la chambre correspond aux photos. Je recommande pour passer un week-end pour visiter la ville !
4,88894108,7/25/2016,Emily,"My son and I had a great time staying in this lovely apartment, which was also in a fantastic neighbourhood - particularly if you have children as the Vondelpark is so close by. The apartment is gorgeous, including a beautiful tranquil roof garden. There are three steep flights of steps up to the apartment so be aware of this if you are traveling with young children."
4,92848020,8/10/2016,Emmet,"My family had a wonderful stay at MarleenâÄôs beautiful home. Although she was on vacation when we arrived, her very friendly neighbour, Francis, was there to greet us and to show us around the house. We were immediately impressed with the house: it is very spacious and bright, with lots of sunshine. In fact, it is the first Airbnb accommodation we have stayed at that actually looks exactly like the photos (most use a wide angle lens, which makes them look 30% larger than they actually are). The home was beautifully furnished, and the beds were comfortable. The kitchen was fully equipped for cooking, and I quite enjoyed the espresso machine to help me start the day. The highlight of the home for us was the rooftop garden, which was a nice place to relax in the evening weather permitting. We also had the pleasure of taking care of the family cat, Moskou, who was no trouble at all. Marleen generously made the familyâÄôs bicycles available for us to use, though we ended up renting, as we needed a bike with a child seat. She also prepared a (Hidden by Airbnb) map of the area with many of her favourite spots highlighted, which made life easier for us. The neighbourhood was quiet, and far enough away from the centre of town for us to experience a genuine Dutch living experience, but within easy cycling distance of the highlights of the city. We stayed for eight days, and would definitely stay at MarleenâÄôs home on our next visit to Amsterdam. I highly recommend staying at this home when visiting Amsterdam."
4,306878911,8/13/2018,Gwen,"Worth the climb! If you don't know Amsterdam, the steep narrow stairs are typical, but unless you have physical issues with this, Marleen's place was simply wonderful--spacious, stylish, and clean, with a very cool rooftop terrace. The location could not have been better. Marleen sent her very nice niece to let us in and show us the place, then we had it to ourselves (except for the cat; yes, there's a sweet little cat--note this for those with allergies). Marleen left instructions for everything and made sure to communicate with us regularly. We had only a week there but we'd love to come back and stay longer."
4,311895749,8/22/2018,Jason,"we had a lovely time at this house.  perfect location, very enjoyable roof top terrace and the excellent coffee set up was a very nice surprise.  we also really loved the company of Moskou the house cat! "
4,510436850,8/16/2019,Kai,"Although the stairs were quite steep, we enjoyed the apartment very much. The roof terrace has a wonderful view of the city and the kitchen is a real bonus. Even as a group of 4 people we didnâÄôt feel cramped at all.<br/>I would recommend this flat to anyone looking for a central, cozy and quiet space in amsterdam."
42,195401840,9/19/2017,Hubert,Estelle was a great host.  Communicated well before we arrived and waited for us till 11pm to hand us the keys.  Apartment has amazing location and within walking distance to everything.  Apartment itself is well maintained with a large balcony that unfortunately we were not able to enjoy due to the rain.  The folder of notes from Estelle about the neighbourhood was very useful as well.
42,205486878,10/22/2017,Eyal,"My wife and I spent 3 nights at Estelle's apartment.<br/>The location is great, the apartment is wonderful and everything is in walking distance.<br/>Estelle was there for any question and I'm sure that our next vacation in Amsterdam we'll check if this apartment is free.<br/>If you're going to spend some nights in Amsterdam this is the place for you!<br/>Thanks Estelle for everything (:"

She left us a nice welcome gift, several pages of places to check out around the area, and made sure we had everything we needed before she left. It's in a fantastic location in my now-favorite neighborhood close to great cafes and wine bars. The shower, bed, and kitchen were fantastic and I would absolutely stay here again the next time I'm in Amsterdam! <br/><br/>One other note - it's 1 flight of steep stairs up from the street entrance, but that wasn't an issue for us; it just wasn't clear to me before booking!"

Wir kÃ¶nnen die Unterkunft voll und ganz empfehlen!!"
71,144590279,4/16/2017,Katharina,"Andrea und Rob waren tolle Gastgeber! Obwohl unser Flug sehr spÃ?t ankam, organisierten die beiden einen Freund, der uns in Empfang nahm. Die Wohnung ist sehr groÃü und lichtdurchflutet und sowohl Badezimmer als auch KÃ?che sind sehr modern. Von Toaster Ã?ber Wasserkocher bis FÃ¶hn ist alles vorhanden. Bei Fragen konnte man sich ohne Probleme an die Gastgeber wenden. Die Wohnung ist nur ein paar Gehminuten von einer Metro in Richtung Stadtmitte entfernt, die alle paar Minuten dort hÃ?lt. Auch beim Check-Out kamen uns Andrea und Rob sehr entgegen und wir konnten unseren letzten Tag noch entspannt nutzen. Ich wÃ?rde die Unterkunft jederzeit wieder buchen :)"
71,168413555,7/9/2017,Darcy,"We had a lovely stay at Andrea & Rob's apartment.  The sunny space is decorated with stylish flair, and there is a balcony area overlooking a courtyard garden.  We enjoyed relaxing with music from the record player  after a day at the Van Gogh Museum and Anne Frank House.  The apartment is in a quiet neighborhood, not far from the city center by tram.  We stayed in four different spaces during our travels, and Andrea & Rob's place was our favorite.  We'd love to return for a longer stay!"
71,192444213,9/10/2017,Jan,"Rob and Andrea are awesome hosts. Their flat is exactly as pictured on the images. Great style and super clean. They were also good advice on where to go.

Aafke hat schnell reagiert und immer umfassende Antworten gegeben. Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt in Amsterdam sehr genossen."
47,95165023,8/18/2016,Georgia,"We stayed in the flat for four nights with our two children (5 and 3). The flat is lovely and is as it is shown in the photos. It's very stylish but also a bit 'lived in' so you can relax in it. The flat is brilliantly placed for the Vondlepark (the entrance to the park is ten steps from the flat) and the fact that you can borrow Aafke's bikes is perfect - we cycled everywhere all week. The flat is great for little kids as there are lots of toys however, like in most apartment buildings in Amsterdam the stairs are very steep! The area is nice and up-and-coming (restaurants and cafes nearby) but it's the park that really makes it - it's huge, peaceful, has a cafe and restaurant in it plus playgrounds etc we cycled through it every day to get to wherever we were going in the city. We highly recommend this flat and hope to be back soon!"
47,96534890,8/23/2016,Robert,This place was really conveniently located. Extremely clean. Checkin and checkout went well. Would highly recommend.

47,109184873,10/20/2016,Leena,"Asunto oli todella viihtyisÃ?, siisti ja sisustettu tyylikkÃ?Ã?sti. Sijainti oli loistava, sillÃ? Vondelpark oli aivan vieressÃ?, ja kaupungin keskustaan saattoi kÃ?vellÃ?, pyÃ¶rÃ?illÃ? tai ajaa raitiovaunulla. <br/><br/>Aafke perheineen oli hyvin avulias ja ystÃ?vÃ?llinen, joten voimme ehdottomasti suositella asuntoa!

47,124574703,1/2/2017,Rita,"We rented the apartment for six days to Aafke and it was a great experience. Great hosts, really kind and always available to help us in their country.

The house is near the center and Vondelpark and easy to get there by transports. Thanks guys!"
47,155447578,5/28/2017,Robbi,Aafke was a great Host. Provided all the info we needed and were there for couple late questions we had. <br/><br/>The apartment was great. Stayed with 2 friends. Right on the tram line and touching Vondelpark. Location was ideal for what we wanted. Looking at a 3âÇ¬ - 12 minute tram to central.<br/><br/>House was very comfortable and stylish. We enjoyed a few meals there and hanging Out.<br/><br/>Highly recommend this flat - so long as you treat it nicely!
47,158952031,6/9/2017,Bettina,"We had a wonderful stay at Aafke`s apartment in Amsterdam. Aafke is a wonderful host. Everything was well prepared when we arrived<br/>and we felt very much at home. The apartment is beautifully situated in a<br/>quiet street right at the Vondelpark yet just around the corner from Cafes,<br/>grocery shops and all you need. After visiting all the different areas of the City during the day we enjoyed cooking together in the evening  just like at home and took long walks in the park before the dark.Thanks to AafkeÂ´s great list of tips, we also rented a car for a day to go to the beach and had a lovely day at the seaside. We would always come back! Thanks again!"
47,185649350,8/22/2017,Helena,"We spent an amazing long weekend with our 4-year old twins at Aafke's place. If you are travelling with children, it is a perfect place to stay - children have their own room with lots of toys, the house is spacious, beautifully decorated and impeccably maintained. It is right on the edge of Vondelpark, with 3 great playgrounds within 5 minutes walk. A supermarket is less that 5 mins away, lots of family-friendly eateries nearby and only a short 10-min tram ride to all the major sights, museums etc. While the place is very family-friendly, it is very modern and has a grown-up feel, so a great place for couples too."

Pulito, molto vivibile, in vicolo cieco molto tranquillo sul verde Vondelpark. Vicino alla fermata del tram. Ristoranti e negozi sulla via principale. Ideale per esplorare la cittÃ  e viverla come residenti. Proprietari molto alla mano e di buon senso, dispensano consigli per e-mail e suggeriscono soluzioni pratiche anche a distanza (erano in vacanza mentre noi abitavamo da loro).

Es war alles da, was wir fÃ?r ein erstes FrÃ?hstÃ?ck brauchten und zusÃ?tzlich gab es noch ein paar Leckereien als WillkommensgruÃü.<br/>Ingrid hatte uns wie versprochen zwei FahrrÃ?der organisiert, so dass wir schnell Ã?berall hingekommen sind. Ansonsten ist man mit der Tram auch sehr schnell im Zentrum oder am Bahnhof.<br/>Ingrid ist eine sehr nette und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin, die uns sofort das GefÃ?hl gegeben hat, zuhause und willkommen zu sein. <br/>Jederzeit wieder!"

66,153493052,5/21/2017,Christine,"Eine gute halbe Stunde FuÃüweg vom Bahnhof bis zu Ingrids Haus muss man schon rechnen, aber das macht Ã?berhaupt nichts, denn man lÃ?uft die ganze Zeit am Wasser entlang, am Kreuzfahrtschiff-hafen und  einigen interessanten GebÃ?uden vorbei. Ingrid ist eine perfekte und sehr sympathische Gastgeberin, die auf alle Fragen bereitwillig antwortet und uns mit allen mÃ¶glichen hollÃ?ndischen Leckereien sehr verwÃ¶hnt hat. Der KÃ?hlschrank war voll!<br/>Und FrÃ?hstÃ?ck bekamen wir auch noch sozusagen ans Bett gebracht. Der Raum ist wunderschÃ¶n und praktisch durchdacht eingerichtet, das neue Bad und die Dusche  wunderbar. Nicht ganz so toll fanden wir eigentlich nur, dass man die Fenster nicht richtig Ã¶ffnen konnte und dass nach vorne raus ein Gitter ist. FÃ?r ihren guestroom hat Ingrid nÃ?mlich die ehemalige Garage umfunktioniert und umgebaut. Allerdings kann man nach hinten raus, im offenen Bad, das Fenster kippen und so haben wir uns durch den leichten Mangel an frischer Luft den Aufenthalt sicher nicht verderben lassen. Insgesamt finde ich die Unterkunft sehr teuer, aber das liegt wohl eher an den horrend angestiegenen Ãúbernachtungspreisen in Amsterdam. Im Rahmen dessen, eine zu empfehlende, pieksaubere und schÃ¶ne Unterkunft."
66,164476781,6/27/2017,Kit,"Ingrid' place is lovely and very clean.  The bed is comfortable.  There is a little refrigerator in the room.  She provided some snacks and drinks there, which I appreciated.  The location is great.  You can even go for a swim in the canal.  It's a very short walk to the 10 Tram, which takes you to all the attractions.  I was only in town for 2 days, so I did not get a chance to take Ingrid up on her offer to show me around the area, but I do not doubt that it would've been a great tour.  Ingrid is a lovely host and was very welcoming from the moment we met!"
66,201406137,10/8/2017,Charlotte,IngridâÄôs place is a very good option when you want to see Amsterdam! It was super clean and stylish. And you get all the privacy you need! Thanks for having us
66,204027650,10/16/2017,Dianna,This place was perfect.   Ingrid went above and beyond with answering all my questions of places to go and see.  She had maps printed up for us on where to bike/run.   And her and Henk were the sweetest things ever.  We enjoyed this better then a hotel!

Probably we could not find better airbnb which is fittable for this word than IngridâÄôs<br/>I could stay at her airbnb with very warm-hearted feeling thanks to favor of her<br/>I definitely recommend her airbnb to someone thinking of trip to Amsterdam
66,252835764,4/12/2018,Danielle,Ingrid is hands down the sweetest host IâÄôve had through AirBnB. SheâÄôs incredibly attentive and goes above and beyond when preparing the room. I really felt like she enjoyed hosting and meeting travelers and that makes this place a definite recommend!
66,253746780,4/15/2018,Sterling,"IngridâÄôs guest room was by far the best Airbnb we stayed in during our 3-week trip to Europe! Everything was beautiful, clean, and she even went the extra mile by providing fresh flowers and food! AMAZING!"
66,256118058,4/22/2018,Patricia,"This is such a fabulous place.. clean, modern and quiet. Ingrid is an amazing host.. she should win an award for her caring ability and beautiful kindness. We felt right at home!It was our first B&B experience... and we felt as if we had hit the jackpot!  Patricia"

66,272221466,6/3/2018,Milan,"The room was clean and lovely, even though it was a little hard to get some fresh air in (there was a window in the bathroom though). Nevertheless, Ingrid welcomed us warmly, and she even left us delicious food (stroopwafels, greek yogurt, beers, wine, cherry tomatoes, tea and coffee, chocolate, cheese, etc.) and toiletries at our disposal inside the room, as well as fresh flowers, which we really appreciated. It's pretty easy to get to the center of Amsterdam by tram (10 and 26), and the neighborhood is pretty calm. We would definitely recommend her AirBnB, we spent a great time there!"
66,274824780,6/10/2018,Bc,"Ingrid's place was clean, tidy and well maintained. The amenities provided were adequate, in our opinion. Access to transport and cafe, restaurant and supermarket was a few minutes away by foot."
66,280473930,6/23/2018,Daryl,"Great spot and very welcoming host, lots of the extra touches that make it special. Neighbourhood is clean and we felt safe, about an 8 min walk to tram station to go downtown. "

66,324532553,9/17/2018,Corine,"De locatie is nog mooier dan ik dacht: je stapt naar buiten en kijkt over het Amsterdam Rijnkanaal, met zoveel lucht en wolken dat je je buiten de stad waant. De kamer zelf heeft een mooi keukentje, de gastvrouw is zo attent als iedereen hier al heeft vermeld. Aanrader dus!"
66,328140724,9/25/2018,Mariana,"Wonderful, charming and stylish, great location with a truly wonderful and flexible host!"
66,365346002,1/1/2019,Emad,"We stayed at IngridâÄôs place over NYE and it was amazing. The place is super cute, clean, quite, and right off the water. But the most amazing and special thing about the apt is Ingrid herself. She was amazing to us, well equipped room with high quality coffee, tea, and other breakfast goodies. She also left us good wine, chocolate, and a fruit basket welcoming us. On NYE she left us a Champaign and her homemade Dutch desert which was super delicious. While being super host, she was also very helpful with local tips and flexible of both our check in and out. Totally recommended :)"
66,427927637,3/24/2019,Christophe,"Great stay, there were a lot of little gifts when we arrived (a bottle of wine, things for breakfast, snacks...) And Ingrid was super nice to meet and reactive to find a setup for the check-in and check-out!<br/>Recommended!"

66,435667494,4/11/2019,Ilse,"Absolutely lovely host who really made our stay that much better! Ingrid filled the fridge with the most delicious foods/drinks as well as making sure we found the local bike shop. The only thing to note was that the room did get quite cold and we visited during spring! The towel rack didnâÄôt work/couldnâÄôt feel the floor heating and the shower was tricky to work as it never was warm enough. Also make sure you get bikes if you want to explore the centre of Amsterdam or be prepared to use UberâÄôs or taxis. Hope to be back soon, thanks so much Ingrid!"
66,436988560,4/14/2019,Karen,"IngridâÄôs place is amazingly pretty, has a really nice touch and she makes you feel at home with all the amenities in the room.<br/><br/>She is a great host, since the first moment you get in touch with her, until you check out. Ingrid is always there to answer any questions or to help with information.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is lovely and calm."
66,440926065,4/21/2019,Aine,"Ingrid is a superhost for a reason, her attention to detail and personal touches will make your stay as special as ours!<br/>We couldnt have asked for a better airbnb, great value, close to the centre, in a great neighbourhood, clean, comfie bed and amazing shower and with many treats when you arrive. Ingrid also was there for any advice regarding our trip and even allowed for a late checkout so we could explore the city more without carrying our bags.<br/><br/>Something my partner and I didnt realise was that the airbnb is a separate space so youre not actually sharing a house with the host. It was a great and very nicely decorated. <br/><br/>Thank you so much we hope to come back to Amsterdam in future!<br/><br/>Aine and Conleth from Ireland"
66,444550911,4/28/2019,Sophie,Lovely accommodation in a beautiful area. Ingrid is a wonderful host and is very helpfully at all times. Would happily recommend to others.

66,479571657,7/1/2019,Corina,"The place is very nice, and very clean. There were fresh flowers, wine, fruits and some other stuff when we arrived, that was perfect because we were very tired to go out. Henk was waiting for us. It is the perfect place if you want to relax and get away from the noise of the center, and if you want to go to the main streets is very well connected or aprox 20 minutes by bike."
66,529824367,9/15/2019,Aine,"Wow! My boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend away. ItâÄôs safe to say that they have set the bar very high for our expectations at our next air b&b. Great location. Very close to tram stop which is 3 stops into town. Ingrid and her partner were so kind and friendly and available to answer all our questions. They offered us a late check out. But it was the little touches in the room. We wanted for nothing. A fridge full of breakfast foods, snacks, wine and beer. The bed and shower also amazing. We will definitely stay here on our next Amsterdam trip."
66,542224072,10/6/2019,Pablo,Excelente recibimiento. Lugar impecable. Vista despejada a los canales. Muy buena conversacion.

44,120571390,12/11/2016,Adrien,"Thank you Janneke for this trip in your beautiful apartment.<br/>It is well-equipped and design, with a large balcony!<br/>The + : the shower is wonderful<br/>Public transport are very close to the appartment, but you need them (15-20min) or bike (25-30min) to go to the city center.<br/>Moreover Janneke was really listening and free to answer to all our questions, she shares with us good informations to enjoy our trip: she is helpfull when you want discover the city.<br/>The description is true.<br/>I recommend  <br/>"
44,135473012,3/5/2017,Laurent,"L'appartement de Janneke Ã©tait trÃ¨s propre et trÃ¨s confortable. Un grand merci Ã  Janneke pour son accueil et ses prÃ©cieuses explications (bons plans). L'appartement est un peu excentrÃ© (trÃ¨s calme) mais bien accessible en transport (bus, tram). Il etait simple de rejoindre le centre ville. Nous avons passÃ© un agrÃ©able sÃ©jour. Un grand merci Ã  Janneke."
44,138192069,3/19/2017,Anouk,"Het appartement van Janneke is netjes, goed bereikbaar en gezellig. We hebben er voor 2 nachtjes gelogeerd. In de buurt zijn restaurantjes waar je kunt eten/drinken maar je bent ook met het openbaar vervoer vlot in de stad."
44,157930690,6/5/2017,Dr. Andrea,It's a great flat for two people and you really have everything you need. It had a really nice bathroom and a really comfortable livingroom arrangement. We had a great time and enjoyed living in the flat over a long weekend. I traveled with a good friend therefore it was no problem at all to charge a bed. The flat is in a quiet neighborhood and you only had to walk 5 min to the next tram station so really easy acces to public transport. There is a supermarket close by and a few little shops and restaurants. I think it's a great flat for a weekend trip to Amsterdam.
44,168323365,7/9/2017,Andrey,"Very nice and clean apartments, quite house. Everything you need to have a good weekend) "
44,195093003,9/18/2017,Luxmi,"Clean, airy, and bright apartment. Enough space to set up our babyâÄôs travel crib in the bedroom. Close enough to easy to navigate public transport. Host communicated promptly and easy check in/out. Yes the walls are quite thin as others have noted, but all we heard were a few voices from the hall and sometimes the muffled sound of a television from a neighbor. (Hopefully our baby didnâÄôt bother the neighbors with his morning babble and occasional cry).  Janneke kindly cleared some closet shelves for us and left a detailed note for apartment and neighborhood, along with resto recommendations. A great stay overall."
44,197298390,9/25/2017,Dennis,"Thank you Janneke for letting me and my wife check in early and for the tasty snacks you left for us. The apartment has many amenities, is very clean, and the front side gets very sunny.  The apartment was far from the main city, but was very close to the trams which quickly and easily got you there.  The building doesnâÄôt have an elevator, so you do have to walk up 2 narrow and curvy flights of stairs which could be an issue if you have large or a lot of luggage.  Overall, my stay was very pleasant."
44,199612933,10/2/2017,Rehan,Janneke's apartment is extremely nice and is a home away from home. From the moment we enquired about her place she was very helpful and always more than happy to help. Whilst staying at the apartment every effort had been made for us to be comfortable and happy with our stay.<br/><br/>Janneke was kind enough to leave comprehensive instructions for our stay and went above and beyond what any hotel could ever offer.<br/><br/>We would highly recommend staying here to anyone and would stay again.<br/><br/>The location of the apartment is a short walk from the nearest tram stop and is very easy to navigate from the airport as well as Central station.<br/><br/>Overall a very pleasant experience and a big thank you to Janneke!
44,214522830,11/26/2017,Anna,"We had an amazing time! The apartment was super clean, very cozy and it's connected to the city centre by public transport. Perfect for a weekend in Amsterdam and Janneke even provided us with some local tips for bars & restaurants."
44,235901739,2/18/2018,Farah,"This, by far, has been my BEST experience with an AirBnb. Janneke is very kind and has a beautiful apartment, which we found clean and supplied with all we needed from coffee/tea to towels. I highly recommend this beautiful space located in a culturally rich neighborhood in Amsterdam and within walking distance from stations and ~30 min walk to city center."

La posizione non Ã¨ centrale, ma Ã¨ molto vicina alla fermata del bus/tram e in 20-30 minuti si puÃ? raggiungere il centro di Amsterdam. Esperienza ottima con Janneke, che ci ha dato tutti i dettagli di cui avevamo bisogno e ci ha lasciato una guida sui luoghi principali da visitare nei dintorni. Decisamente consigliato!"
44,269391223,5/27/2018,Melissa,We had a wonderful stay in Jannekes appartement. Everything was very clean and it had a great interior. It's a beautiful appartement and you have plenty of room and a nice balcony. The neighborhood is nice and quiet and not far away from the center. It's a 10-15 min ride with the tram. There are supermarkets and nice restaurants in walking distance. <br/>The communication was very good. Janneke is very nice and gave us all the information we needed in advance and the best direction to her appartement. We were also very happy about the late Check-out and that we were able to leave our baggage in the appartement until our flight.<br/>We felt very welcomed and would definitely stay here again :)
44,417146490,2/26/2019,Ashleigh,Janneke's place is the perfect place to stay for a weekend in Amsterdam. The little walk to reach the town center through the canals is lovely and the price is unbeatable compare to more central place. The place offers everything you need and Janneke was lovely providing us with tips and info to make your stay even more enjoyable!
44,419601271,3/4/2019,Matt,We really enjoyed our stay here. The apartment is clean and really comfortable. It's super easy to get around with loads of tram and bus routes nearby.

44,554401600,10/26/2019,Gavin,"Great place to stay and come home to after a day out. sparkling clean with all the amenities you need. Janneke went the extra mile by writing notes to help us find our way and other usefull info. Sad not to have met her, but happy we chose her home. Only dissapointment was how far out of the main tourist points it was located, but would stay there again."

55,117185079,12/5/2016,Dunja,The best thing about this place is that you get to experience how the locals live. It's in a typical Dutch building with steep narrow stairs :-) in a quiet residential area. Kitchen is very well equipped. The bedroom window view is towards inner courtyard and spruce tree. During the day the apartment gets a lot of sunlight. Communication was very smooth.

55,147190490,4/25/2017,Kelsey,"This was such a cute place to stay right outside of the central downtown area. It was a really cool neighborhood that allowed us to experience Amsterdam like a local but was still within walking distance to many things, like all of the museums. It was perfect way to end our trip! "
55,147723001,4/28/2017,Philip,"Nice, spacious one bed flat in De Pijp. All as advertised. WiFi, towels, hairdryer all present & correct. Smooth check-in.

"
60,146536111,4/23/2017,Shana,"Sandra's place was lovely. The bedroom looks onto a cute interior courtyard, and is very comfortable and quiet.

60,249452411,4/2/2018,Zahari,"The apartment is great, Kobe made quck and very helpful introduction to the place and neghbourhood to us and gave us all the information we needed. The site is quiet and peaceful just next to Amstel river and only 15min with bycicle to the crowded downtown area with all the tourists. We appreciate the location very much esepcially after long day spending with the crowd in city center, was good to come back to our quiet place and relax. Definitely we'll come back again in Samdras's apartment."
60,260602255,5/4/2018,Corinne,"Nous avons passÃ© un sÃ©jour trÃ¨s agrÃ©able dans l'appartement de Sandra. Le quartier est trÃ¨s sympathique et trÃ¨s bien situÃ©.

She also had useful information about the city. We even had some goodies on arrival! We were able to check in early and leave our luggage later on the day we left - she was very accommodating. The apartment was a bit further than we expected from the city centre but definitely walking distance and very close if you hire a bike. We would not hesitate to stay again! A great place to stay in Amsterdam. "

I loved being in a regular Amsterdam neighborhood and also within walking distance of the sights. Sunsets over the Amstel are unreal. The apartment itself was perfect for my needs. The bed was cozy. The garden in back was a special touch, and Eva and Kobe did everything to make me comfortable. I really appreciated the thoughtfulness of the visit. Thanks, Sandra, Eva and Kobe! I would love to come back soon!"

60,306211407,8/12/2018,Jan,"During our stay in Amsterdam, SandraâÄòs apartment really was the perfect homebase for us :)<br/><br/>ItâÄòs located in a quiet and relaxed neighborhood. The next metro is super close (like 5 minutes of walk). From there the metro takes you to central station in a few minutes, from where you can reach the whole city center easily by foot.<br/><br/>If there isnâÄòt any metro driving in the late evening, itâÄòs also possible to just walk back to the apartment (I even recommend to do this at least once, strolling along the amstel is just beautiful!)<br/><br/>The apartment itself is very clean and cozy, you will find absolutely everything you need (cooking, washing, etc.). There are also some good places to relax in the apartment, like a comfortable couch inside or a nice lounge outside.<br/><br/>The check-in and check-out procedures were really easy and managed by Eva & Kobe, the co-hosts of the apartment. The communication with them went very smooth and if necessary they were very good reachable.<br/><br/>So finally I would recommend this apartment to everyone for a nice trip to Amsterdam, itâÄòs just a great place to stay. I would definitely go there again!"

35,131220678,2/11/2017,Mat,"Friendly and helpful host in a very convenient location. The apartment is in an ideal location if you're not looking to be right in the centre. I can suggest getting a tram/bus/metro pass for your stay as there are plenty of stops and stations very close by which can take you into town very cheaply and easily. Nassira is perfect! Very neat, clean and tidy; ideal if you are the same. Lovely underfloor heating makes it feel very cosy. Also did I mention that there is Netflix on the TV and fast wifi? 10/10!!!"
35,133264807,2/21/2017,Katherine,"AMAZING!!! This apartment is amazing! It is beautiful, modern and comfy. It's close to everything but not too close to the ""madness"" of Amsterdam. Very nice quiet neighborhood. Very good wifi/cable. The bed is super comfy and there's heated floors!! The host Nassira is simply amazing. We will deff be staying here again.  "
35,135230222,3/4/2017,Carina,"Nassira is an amazing host! She was waiting for us in the apartment in the morning to receive us as she managed to do our check in according to our time of arrival which was perfect for us! She explained how everything works in the apartment and also sent us a text later on with a lot of tips and hints, good places to go and visit in Amsterdam. The apartment is around 15/20 minutes walking distance to the city centre and its perfectly doable as Amsterdam is a plane city but you also have a lot of public transports just 5 min or less from the apartment. Specially, if you buy the I AMSTERDAM card you will actually be able to use the public transports for free, have free entrance to a lot of museums and a lot of discounts in restaurants :) Also, just a tip, there is a Portuguese restaurant,  Girassol, right around the corner from the apartment and the food is superb! <br/>We had a lovely stay and will definitely book Nassira's place again! <br/>Thank you for everything Nassira :)"

The presentation of the space was very nice. It was clean and thoughtfully decorated with the cutest enclosed back patio. My partner and I stayed for a few days and found that the place was a short walk or a cheap Uber ride to just about everything we wanted to go to. There are several great restaurants nearby, (my favorite was Drovers Dog) and the neighborhood is trendy. The Canal is a very short walk and the view is breathtaking. I would absolutely recommend staying. I know that I will return one day soon if I am fortunate enough!"

It was very clean and Fatima was friendly and helpful upon check-in.

35,453284029,5/15/2019,Lindsey,NassiraâÄôs place is a great little studio just along the Amstel river. We were in a great neighborhood that was very quiet but still only about 15-20 minute walk to get into the main parts of Amsterdam. She was always accessible for questions and really made us feel at home. ItâÄôs the perfect place for a couple or two friends who donâÄôt mind sharing a VERY COMFORTABLE bed! The little patio in the back was great as well (if weather allows). All in all I would definitely recommend NassiraâÄôs place to anyone!
35,456698012,5/22/2019,Stacy,"This place is fantastic! ItâÄôs a lovely apartment on the ground floor with outdoor space. ItâÄôs just outside the city center in a quiet neighborhood with a few restaurants, bars and grocery stores. <br/>ItâÄôs a 5-10 minute walk to catch the metro (subway), the tram or the larger trains. So easy to get anywhere you want to go. <br/>Nassira responded quickly to any communication and graciously accommodated our early morning arrival. She even left us treats to enjoy when we arrived. Check in and out was very simple. <br/>ItâÄôs a perfect space for two people with a king-sized bed, living space and small kitchen. IâÄôd recommend this space to anyone I knew. <br/>DonâÄôt let the location outside the city center deter you. ItâÄôs so easy to travel anywhere with transit, and we felt perfectly safe walking home from the stations even very late at night."

54,290862592,7/15/2018,Damien,"The airbnb property management servicer was HORRIBLE. The guy was rude and made a scandal because we hadnt left the flat at noon. We were just waiting for him to arrive before leaving and we litterally left the flat 5 min after his arrival. And finally, when we were supposed to shake hands to say goodbye, the guy shot my phone (unwillingly) which exploded on the floor (the phone is new btw). The servicer (or cleaner i dont know) didnt express a single odd of regret nord apologies and remain literraly despicable despite thame fact that he crashed my iphone. To be honest, on the other end, the place was clean and very well located. A bit expensive for the price but as always in amsterdam.<br/>"

17,161231533,6/17/2017,Chris,Tom and Eva were very gracious hosts with a comfortable apartment. I consider having morning breakfast on the back patio here to be one the best experiences of going to Amsterdam. Beautiful place with a lovely view off the back balcony. Two bedrooms on opposite sides of apartment provided privacy for my wife and I and the couple we traveled with. Tom and Eva left a very helpful packet with museum discounts and information about the area. Location is not too far from touristy city center and has its own lovely charm. Easy 5 min walk to public train. Nice 15 min walk to the very large and beautiful Vondelpark which was a great place to have a picnic and chill. We would stay here again.
17,162973472,6/23/2017,George,Tom and Eva were great hosts. Check in was easy. I would suggest they always make sure that the flat is always well cleaned before renting out. I had minor cleaning issues at first but the host was quick to fix them the same day.

17,242588967,3/12/2018,Aneesah,Nice flat close to shops. Would have been perfect apart from the cat peeing on one of the beds which was a little annoying as we had to change and wash the sheets but other then that it was great.

Consigliatissimo. <br/><br/>P.S : Unica nota negativa Ã¨ che non Ã¨ lâÄôideale per chi non ama i gatti o gli animali, Zorro il gatto di Tom Ã¨ carinissimo ma spesso te lo ritrovi accanto senza accorgertene con magari i gatti del vicino al suo fianco."

88,143755338,4/13/2017,Elke,"Dirks place is located in a lovely neighbourhood. Close to the center, a stone's throw away from the Vondelpark, plenty of cool bars and restaurants in the vicinity. The apartment itself is charming - I had some serious interior design envy. The perfect place to come home to after a day of wandering around. Dirk is an excellent host. Communicative, warm, accomodating, full of interesting stories and insights. I can only recommend staying here."
88,144571737,4/16/2017,Ulyana,"Gorgeous apartment in a perfectly place.  All information about apartment are true.  I recommend it.  Thanks a lot, Dirk!"
88,145069137,4/17/2017,Fengwei,Beautiful environment and peaceful place to stay. Dirk was very friendly and responsive as well  :)

88,150470697,5/8/2017,Indrajeet,"Dirk has a beautiful room, very cozy place, nice bed and a room full of books, music LPs, which gives a very home like feeling. Only worry we felt was a tall staircase, almost vertical, since we had one big bag. <br/><br/>The host is an amazing guy. He helped us haul the bag, offered us tea and coffee, gave very good suggestions on food and what to see. Overall, a wonderful, cozy place to stay in Amsterdam, far from madness of crowds in Dam Square. Excellent connectivity thru Tram and lots of food places around, with a big Vondelpark. "
88,151151218,5/11/2017,Jesse,"Dirk and Marte were wonderful. The apartment is from the early 20th century and filled with a variety of curious artifacts including a 17th century portrait to which Dirk is a direct descendent of. Its located in a quaint and charming neighborhood with delicious and inexpensive cafes which Dirk and Marte will be more than happy to provide recommendations. Be sure to also spend some time with Dirk and Marte as well as they are both interesting and highly hospitable people. I highly recommend this property.<br/>P.S, check out Dirk's amazing book collection!"
88,151355512,5/12/2017,Andrew,It's tucked away nicely between vondel park and busy street. So it was easy to get a good nights rest and quick access to food. 
88,151538012,5/13/2017,Oshri,"A truly amazing house, comfortable, clean and beatifuly designed. Communication with Marte was great, and she was very kind and helpful. A highly recommended place!"
88,152444521,5/16/2017,Irina,"I fell in love with Dirk & Marte's apartment. So charming and delightful, every detail down to perfection, lots of fun and quirky things here and there around the house. Bedroom was comfortable and since the area is quiet, we had a great sleep. Dirk was kind enough to wait for us when we were late for check-in - thanks for that - and he recommended nice places we could visit in the neighborhood. If you've got an artistic streak, this is the place for you :)"
88,154830277,5/26/2017,Fabiola Marina,"Dirk's place is unreal so confortable, clean, close to the public transport also just a few steps from Voldenpark also she gave us all the support that we needed since before the check-in until we left her place. Thank you so much Dirk and see you next time for sure. "
88,155396431,5/28/2017,Evan,"Great place to stay if you want to be near the tourist areas of Amsterdam without all the crowds. Transport is very easy between airport, apartment, and Central Amsterdam. My tip would be to get back a little before the trains stop so you can have a beer at Fijnkost. "
88,156834546,6/1/2017,Monika,its great!
88,157327845,6/3/2017,Les,"Dirk's apartment is in a fine part of Amsterdam, close to Vondel Park. The apartment itself was 'quirky' with many interesting artefacts, reflecting Dirks interest in art. Dirk was very welcoming and interesting to talk to on many different subjects."
88,157454753,6/4/2017,Dominique,Dirk was an amazing guest! My colleague and I were arriving early in Amsterdam and he was so accommodating. Thanks for the great stay Dirk!

88,159428434,6/11/2017,Patrick,"The place is in a nice neighborhood with plenty of shops and restaurants. Of course Vondelpark is right in the backyard and is a great place to hang out for a bit after spending time in the city. The tram stop is also close, so it is easy to get everywhere you need to go. Great host with a comfortable place to stay. Thank you."
88,160473539,6/14/2017,Beatrix,Such a wonderful location and host! The whole apartment is exactly as pictured and the room is very comfortable. Dirk was incredibly kind and easy to be around and share space with. I would highly suggest this place to future travelers and will definitely try and come back. Thanks again Dirk!  
88,162315987,6/20/2017,June,"Dirk and Martin's place is as lovely as them two. it is very near by Vendol park. There are so many books and a piano in the living room,never forget that Dirk played piano when my friend and me had to work late,you know ,everything is perfect .The days we spent there are so good memories I will always recall. If you wanna have a slow down ,quiet journey ,I recommend Dirk and Martin's :)"
88,165901136,7/2/2017,Phoebe,"<br/>We enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam and the location of the apartment was perfect. We would have liked a little more storage space in the bedroom, especially if we were staying any longer. Dirk and Marte were chilled, welcoming and quick to reply to any messages. The beds were extremely comfortable! "
88,167032771,7/5/2017,Ginny,"Our hosts were incredibly friendly and communicative from the moment we booked and throughout our stay. The accommodations were clean and lovely, nice touches like water and tea. The location is great, close to the tram and Vondelpark. We would absolutely recommend staying here!"
88,167561746,7/7/2017,Nancy,"Dirk and Marte were fantastic hosts! They were super flexible and their apartment is so dreamy. The room was comfortable, and thoughtfully well-supplied, including a guide to Amsterdam and much more. The apartment is well-located. It's only a short tram ride away from the city center, and surrounding neighborhood is packed with restaurants and shops. Thanks for being great hosts, and giving me what felt like a really authentic Dutch stay! "
88,170356809,7/15/2017,Ãñzcan,"It was such an amazing experience! We totally loved the place, especially the fact that it was near to vondelpark, which is near to everything. And Martha and Dirk were really kind and friendly to us. Best place to stay in the whole city <3"
88,171268729,7/17/2017,Bernard,"Great location, cozy house, extremely friendly place, I wanted to extend my stay just to be able to check all the books and vinyls available in the flat! :)"
88,172615481,7/21/2017,Lan & Bjorn,I and my niece stayed two nights at this lovely apartment with charming nerboughood and easy public communication with tram. Plenty of lights and space. Angela who met us was very friendly and helpful. The rum is perfect for one person or a couple. We recommend it very warmly.
88,173431440,7/23/2017,Anne,"This is a fun and extremely comfortable apartment in a wonderful location next to Vondelpark and convenient to the tram. I highly recommend staying here. Although I did not meet Dirk and Marte, staying in their home gives you a sure sense of their joy in life. Think long friendly dining table, eclectic art, and the vinyl already on the turntable. Their friend, A., took care of my booking, and I cannot say enough about how delightfully friendly and warm she was. A perfect visit!"
88,174858851,7/27/2017,Christelle,L'appartement est trÃ¨s bien situÃ© Ã  cÃ´tÃ© du Parc Vondel. L'endroit est magnifique et proche du centre Ã  vÃ©lo ou en tram.
88,177870492,8/4/2017,DeNai,Quiet spot with such great home decor and very light with a great window right next to the bed <br/><br/>We lived the airflow and the beds were comfortable as well<br/><br/>Good location for exploring!
88,179364856,8/7/2017,Daniel,Angela was a great host told us everywhere to go places to see and check in was very easy it backs up to Vondel park Like explain and was very easy to navigate to downtown
88,180064405,8/9/2017,Viktoria,"Great apartment with lots of character, very comfortable and clean (just be prepared for the staircase leading up to it, which is steep and long - even for Dutch standards! But the climb is totally worth it). <br/>It is easy to get there from the station or the airport, it is next to a large park, and while it is centrally located, the area is not touristy at all. Angela also gave me some great tips about places to eat. I just wish I could have managed to open the bike lock - Angela told me it was a little tricky, but I should have asked her to show me the trick!<br/>Recommended!"
88,181125303,8/12/2017,Charlene,"This is a great place with plenty of light and eclectic furnishings. Where we currently live we are starved for green spaces, and the nearby (5 min, max) Vondelpark was amazing. <br/><br/>We spent most of our waking hours outside of the home, but the time we spent in our room was very comfortable and quiet. There is a quiet little neighborhood bar near the place that has great outdoor seating - we stopped in for a drink and enjoyed ourselves.<br/><br/>As a FYI, the place is at the top of a fairly steep set of stairs; we're fine with steps and all, but if you have a lot of luggage or trouble navigating steps you'll find it a bit challenging.<br/><br/>The vegetarian options in Amsterdam are many and the recommendations provided were great. We'd totally stay at this place again for the location and amenities."
88,182800881,8/15/2017,Olivier,Super sÃ©jour Ã  Amsterdam.<br/><br/>Angela et son ami sont des hÃ´tes trÃ¨s agrÃ©ables. Ils nous ont donner de bonnes adresses et son trÃ¨s sympathiques.
88,183769739,8/18/2017,Melissa,Very steep staircase and it smells a bit odd but is fine in the actual apartment which you share with the residents.  Vintage style decorations in an old building made quaint and livable by fascinating people
88,184691546,8/20/2017,William,Pretty good area in vondelpark.  Area is a bit secluded from the main areas but within reasonable walking distances. Good place to stay for value.
88,187127311,8/26/2017,Michael,"Wir haben ein langes Wochenende in Dirks Wohnung verbringen dÃ?rfen. Wir haben es sehr genossen. Die Wohnung war noch wohnlicher als man es Worten beschreiben, noch in Bildern einfangen kÃ¶nnte. Dirk war hilfsbereit und stand uns stets mit RatschlÃ?gen und Tips zur Seite. Bedankt!"

88,195167082,9/18/2017,Valeska,Un poco alejado del centro de la ciudad pero cerca de la locomociÃ?n son buenos anfitriones y un departamento lindo un poco dificil de subir con los bolsos pero solo eso
88,195871637,9/21/2017,Shuying,nice stay. strategic location. friendly host.
88,197319193,9/25/2017,Omar,Great place to stay near Vondelpark - a cozy and clean room with a host to match! The use of the bike is a definite perk.
88,197911025,9/27/2017,Lucy,"Dirk's place was the perfect spot for my brief stay. The apartment is very cute and cozy and it is very well located next to the park. The hosts were very helpful with ideas and communication, but also let me do my own thing. I had a great experience staying here as a solo traveler."
88,199163246,10/1/2017,Regis,"Een aanrader! Dirk en Marte zijn heel verwelkomend en gastvrij en de woonst heeft een unieke gezellige sfeer en is goed gelegen. De eigenaars geven goede tips, stellen alles ter beschikking en tegelijkertijd geven ze veel vrijheid. De auto kan iets verderop geparkeerd worden aan dagtarief. Mijn zoon van 12jr heeft genoten van de uitstappen naar de verschillende buurten, de 'Amsterdam Dungeon', de Foodhall, Madame Tussaud's, Anne Frank huis (tickets online bestellen!)."
98,144125834,4/14/2017,Pierre,The host canceled this reservation 433 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
98,175979660,7/30/2017,Julian,"We stayed at this home for holidays and liked every aspect of our stay. The house was big enough for 5 adults and one child. By tram it is easy to reach the centrum and other tourist hotspots. Nixo the cat was really easy to take care of. We will gladly consider this home again for our next Amsterdam trip, if the hosts are comfortable with renting to us again. "
98,177943085,8/4/2017,Frances,We were a family of 7 staying for 5 days.  Townhome was a great place to stay to access downtown by tram.  Good restaurants and grocery stores within short walking distance.  Great park nearby for kids to run. Fantastic outdoor patio for morning coffee and quiet pleasant neighborhood. Marike and Joef were wonderful hosts. Thank you!
98,295794997,7/24/2018,Sherry,"We enjoy our stay at this house, it was clean and private, quite area and host was really helpful."

34,144695499,4/16/2017,Lara,"Leonie had a nice warm welcome to her amazing home. The location is great with all sorts of supermarkets, restaurants and public transport right under the house. Her home is fabulous: sunny, modern, comfortable so I would highly recommend a stay at Leonie's! "
34,150534764,5/8/2017,Regina,"We stayed at Leonie's for three nights and had a fantastic time. The flat was bright, clean, stylish and peaceful. Fantastic location for exploring the city. Great restaurants and bars close by. Overall a winner!<br/>"
34,160268865,6/13/2017,Erkut,awesome 
34,163298184,6/24/2017,Nikhil,"Amazing home in a beautiful neighborhood. Cannot emphasize enough how central this location was, and how close it was to anywhere you want to go in the city. On all the major tram tracks and a fast train ride got us back and forth. If you have difficulty with stairs the walkway was just a little steep, but a fully pregnant wife did fine!  You'll enjoy this home immensely and the decor, spaciousness, cleanliness and amenities made this a highlight of Amsterdam!"
34,164417401,6/27/2017,Gielane,"Leonie's apartment is very stylish, bright and spacious! My daughter doesn't want to leave the apartment and glued on Netflix! :) It's away from the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam but the tram is right next. There are good breakfast spots around and Albert Heijn is a minute away. Thanks Leonie for accommodating our family!:)"
34,165215570,6/30/2017,Liz,"Loenie's place was great. Big, clean, full of light, beautifully decorated, in a cool part of the Oud West. Walking distance to the touristy areas but you're in an actual neighborhood, which is ideal. Leonie was very friendly and easy to get in touch with. I'd recommend her place to anyone and would happily stay there again!"
93,194501151,9/17/2017,Vanessa,Unfortunately we had an apartment change. So I cannot write about this apartment. We were able to stay at the owners apartment and it turned out great.  the apartment was cozy and was well organized. The communication was easy and fast. We loved the area.<br/>definitely can recommend this host
93,199868035,10/3/2017,Rita,"Hi Willie, thank you for your hospitality and for your communication throughout our stay.! We had a really great time, discovering this new neighborhood in Amsterdam. Great food, and very easy transport options to other parts of the city. The apartment was very comfortable, and perfect for a couple. Many nearby conveniences like the local Lidl, nearby concept stores like Anna and Nina, and much more."
93,202156217,10/10/2017,Johan,"We spend 5 days in Amsterdam, in Willie's appartement.<br/>A really nice stay, even if the weather was not with us. <br/>A nice place to discover the city. Like 20min walking from the red light district, in a really nice district too, less touristic than the center. Not so far from the parc, the zoo...<br/>The appartement is perfect for a couple, proper, and atypical, as the city where it is.<br/>You are close to all the commodity and Liddl in front is perfect to not go to far to buy stuff.<br/>We enjoyed ! Thx!"
93,203949135,10/16/2017,Annie,Super nice apartment and great location! Loved it!!!
93,205910296,10/23/2017,Finn,"Willie was very quick to respond to messages. Also, the apartment is in a great location. It's lovely area with nice bars and cafes around, and it's not far from the city centre. We had an excellent time."
93,207534543,10/29/2017,Clayton,Great location. WiFi is not the best. Clean.
93,224442848,1/3/2018,Oliviah,"The apartment was located in a lovely area close to the local supermarket ,cafes and shops. Was about a 25 minute walk to the Center. House was nice to stay in very simple but it has a lot of potential."
93,233946597,2/11/2018,Alice,"Lovely area, beautiful apartment! Would definitely come stay again"
93,236423244,2/19/2018,Marc,Nice cosy Appartement just as mentioned by Willie. Willie is a very nice and great host. Definately recommended!
93,247385881,3/28/2018,Markus,"Willie's apartment in Amsterdam - de Pijp is a great place to stay at and to enjoy this wonderful city and the people who live there. The Albert Cuyp market is really just across the road. There are plenty of restaurants (we ate out vegan on 5 days and didn't visit one place twice!) and pubs really close to the flat. The apartment itself is to reach via quite steep but classical Amsterdam staircases - do not bring too heavy luggage (or use the hook at he rooftop if you got a very long rope with you ;-). Willie was always there when we needed him and was a very good host! This place is absolutely recommendable for groups up to 4-5 people if you are eager to share beds. It also is good for families or couples. I want to end this rating with a quote of the staff of the coffeeshop Ibiza opposite of the flat: ""Your last day in Amsterdam man? You either make it to count or to forget! If you make it to forget - you might have already made it to count! Love this city and will return soon for sure."
93,252830791,4/12/2018,Elliot,"Good location, comfy beds, quick responses from Willie, would definitely stay again"
93,256142411,4/22/2018,Monica,"LâÄôalloggio ci Ã¨ parso caro rispetto a quello che offre(soprattutto per il bagno....molto spartano!) mancava carta igienica e scarsi asciugamani <br/>Host gentile e molto disponibile <br/>Ottima posizione, ma piÃ? piccolo di qto sembra nelle foto."
93,258582306,4/29/2018,Stefanie,"Das Appartement ist super gelegen! In einem schÃ¶nen hippen Wohngebiet mit vielen Bars und Restaurants. Es ist etwa 20 Minuten zu FuÃü in die Innenstadt entfernt und mehrere SupermÃ?rkte befinden sich in der nÃ?heren Umgebung. Wir hatten einen wunderschÃ¶nen Aufenthalt im Appartement, auch wenn die KÃ?chenausstattung etwas besser sein kÃ¶nnte. Nehmt auf keinen Fall schweres GepÃ?ck mit (so wie ich!)  die Treppen sind typisch hollÃ?ndisch steil!!!"
93,262251229,5/8/2018,Jisu,Willie's flat has been a perfect choice to enjoy Amstersam. Flat was clean and spacious and has a lovely view of sunset. Neighbourhood is very chilled with bars and restaurants in walking distance.

93,568923036,11/25/2019,Simon,Super schÃ¶ne Unterkunft mit wunderschÃ¶nem Ausblick und zentraler Lage. 10min bis zum Zentrum und sehr nahe der nÃ?chsten sbahn Station gelegen. Perfekt fÃ?r bis zu 4 Leuten. <br/><br/>-nicht fÃ?r Menschen geeignet fÃ?r die Treppen steigen eine Schwierigkeit darstellt. <br/><br/>Der Gastgeber ist sehr gut zu erreichen und ist super flexibel. Danke dafÃ?r. <br/>Die Wohnung ist mit allem was man benÃ¶tigt ausgestattet und sauber. <br/>Wir freuen uns auf einen weiteren Besuch.
93,574555785,12/8/2019,Gherardo,We stayed in Willie's apartment for three nights. We really appreciate the house style and its atmosphere. In our opinion there was enough room for four people. <br/>The bathroom is quite unconfortable because it is tiny and the sink is very little.<br/>We found the apartment cozy and very quiet.

She met us at the bus stop and helped carry our bags up.<br/><br/>Her place is a great value, especially for a large private room so close to downtown. The place wasn't the cleanest, but for the value was still ok."
57,194194470,9/16/2017,Polona,Very lovely to stay a few days. It is a 20 minute ride to Amsterdam central with a bus which comes every 10 minutes. Quiet area. We really liked our stay here.

32,177520300,8/3/2017,Francesco,"The house is nice and not so far from a metro station (5 minuts walking) but it has some issues: badly kept, lots of insects and leeking sink. The real problem is that the host wasn't avaible for almost one week when she said she would be, and answered our questions the day before our departure when it was useless. "

67,181121477,8/12/2017,Ernest,"Ehab is gracious, accommodating host. I enjoyed my stay greatly. The little palace is clean, cozy and perfectly located just outside the Centrum to enjoy quiet alone time but just a quick 5-10 minute walk to restaurants, museums, redlight district and transit. The morning view out the windows is perfect view to start your day in Amsterdam. There is also a bike rental shop (Mike's bike rental) 2 blocks away, convenient for easy pick up/drop off, and they rent over night. The little palace is great for solo or couple travelers. I highly recommend choosing Ehab as your host, you won't be disappointed."
67,181814684,8/13/2017,Valentin,"The apartment is really close to the center and the train station, it's very convenient ! You can find everything in this beautiful apartment. Besides Ehab is really kind and helpful !! <br/>Thanks again ! "
67,190031500,9/3/2017,Farah,Fantastic place. Startegically located right on the edge of town. Excellent view. Highly recommended. Quick note to technically minded guests: there's no HDMI on the TV. No big deal.

67,214242189,11/25/2017,Becca,"Ehab's apartment was fantastically located, well within walking distance to all city center hilights and the train station (which was a huge plus whilst lugging bags through the city). He was very accommodating about allowing us to check in rather early, due to a morning flight, and check out a bit late. Overall, excellent stay-- thank you!"
67,216156416,12/3/2017,Viktor,Perfect! Thanx

67,243232241,3/15/2018,Xander,"Ehab could not have been a better host. He answered messages quickly, worked with my crazy schedule, provided tips and even where he got this killer key holder (which i had to have).<br/><br/>The location was central to everything that i needed and once i got used to thr layout, the spot couldnt have been any easier.<br/><br/>Amzing place. I hope to stay here again when its a lot warmer"
67,246787183,3/26/2018,Per,"Nice modern Apartment, near the city center with view to the canal and the harbour. Great communication with the owner, who also showed great flexibility."

67,254822801,4/18/2018,Stephanie,"Ehab was very communicative and worked with my schedule for check-in and check-out. The flat is beautifully decorated and the view can't be beat- you literally see a canal from the couch. It is a very comfortable flat with basic amenities. I enjoyed the Nespresso coffee maker. He also left a few snacks which came in handy when I needed a quick bite before the coffee places opened :) The flat is very easy to walk to anywhere you are going. Just a note- if you are using Uber- use the address for Oracle instead, putting this address puts the Uber behind the building instead of in front."
67,256664198,4/23/2018,Rick James,Thanks so much for card you gave us upon arrival. Very thoughful and meant alot to my wife and I. Outstanding hospitality and very friendly. Would reccomend this spot to anyone looking to be close to the heart of Amsterdam
67,259583126,5/1/2018,Jayce,Great place.  Just a little far from central Amsterdam.  Expect a 25 minute walk to Centraal.

67,274833669,6/10/2018,Frederica,"Ehab was always very quick to respond, friendly and easy going - a true five star host! The apartment is close to the train station and the center yet still in a quiet neighborhood. Everything was spotless and the apartment had all the amenities I required for my visit. I had a fantastic stay and can recommend EhabâÄôs apartment to anyone looking to stay at a central but quiet place."
67,279698899,6/21/2018,Yuki,We have a nice time in EhabâÄôs house that is good location and well equipped! Its value for money. Much appreciated that Ehab always responds quickly and provides immediate support
67,284180359,7/1/2018,Jynnie,"The host was perfect:) great communication.

89,194697044,9/17/2017,Eva,Alice and Ro are the most kind and loving hosts we could have wished for our stay in Amsterdam. Together with their small dog Boef they made our trip even more special and pleasant. Their small apartment is super litty and chill and in a good location with a cozy bedroom for lovely dreams. A definite plus was the amazing welcome gift! We approve this accommodation and would always recommend 
89,198422103,9/29/2017,Atul,"Definitely recommend it. Particularly very near to Science park. Alice, Ro, and Boueff are super fun and lovely :)"
89,199101973,10/1/2017,Michael,"Alice and Ro's place is all my girlfriend and I needed for a couple nights in Amsterdam. The room was clean, cozy, and had a nice balcony. It is walking distance (2 miles to the major parts of Amsterdam) or there are plenty of public transportation options. The surrounding neighborhood was quite and low key."
89,200670380,10/6/2017,Leon,"These two are using Airbnb in the way it is meant to be: let other people have the chance to get an authentik insight about the lifestyle in their City.<br/>They are completely trustworthy and very kind!<br/>Sadly, we didn't got to see the dog =("
89,201364691,10/8/2017,Tina,"Alice and Roo are amazing hosts, very friendly and accommodating. We had a really great time and the area is great with lots of lovely bars and restaurants"
89,203562882,10/15/2017,Helen,"I recommend this place to anyone searching for a good room to stay in while visiting Amsterdam! Alice and Ro are incredibly sweet and give great recommendations for cafes, clubs, bars, etc. around the city. They were also very flexible with our check-out and check-in time which was super helpful and kind. They are in a quiet area and right next to a tram that goes straight into downtown."
89,205435679,10/22/2017,David,"Alice and Ro are one of the best hosts that I have ever had. They were really friendly and communicative, making us feel like at home. I highly recommend the house for everybody who wants to spend a nice time in Amsterdam."
89,206420912,10/25/2017,Sydney,We loved our stay at Alice and Ro's! They are wonderful hosts and very friendly! They made sure one of them was home to greet us and even had a little welcoming gift on our bed! Their place has a great location and is really easy to get to from the city. Everything was clean and nice. I would definitely recommend staying with them!
89,207118242,10/28/2017,Valentin,Position of the apartment is perfect. With bike you can reach Amsterdam centraal in only 10-15 minutes. Alice and Ro are really friendly host.<br/><br/>The big minus in this apartment is bathroom - is so small and inside of the shower cabin is really dirty.
89,208174777,10/31/2017,Elvis,"Alice and Ro are a very nice couple, the bedroom is nice and cozy, and it isnâÄôt to far from the center of Amsterdam. Overall we had a wonderful stay!"
89,212804778,11/19/2017,Baptiste,"Our host is very friendly and he has been very flexible about our arrival time which was very convenient. Besides, the appartment is very close to Javastraat where you can find very nice bars. Thanks!"
89,213851562,11/23/2017,Boris,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
89,214624361,11/26/2017,Elane,Great Host! Nice flat! Nice Area!I had so much fun! Thx a lot!!!
31,212347301,11/17/2017,Takaaki,This room is awesome. It was my first time to stay on the boat and it would be memorable for me. The furniture is cute and there is a big bed so I got a great time in there.<br/>My friend also satisfied everything in this room.<br/>Thank you so much.
31,212791848,11/19/2017,Darryl,"This is a great choice of accommodation in Amsterdam. It's possible to walk to most attractions easily. Mark and Olaf are great hosts, they have really good local knowledge, excellent communication and made check in/out very easy. The boat makes a really nice cosy retreat when it's time to call it a night..."
31,214658404,11/26/2017,Alexandre,The spot is at 10 minutes from Red Lights & all the Amsterdam's attraction.<br/>The boat is a really romantic place.<br/>We really recommand this place :) !!!<br/>Cheers
31,216256947,12/3/2017,Damian,"The boat is in an excellent location. Very easy to get to and from central either by foot or by metro. The boat is very spacious and lovely and warm. ItâÄôs in quiet area but only a ten minute walk from Rembrandt square. The bed was fabulous, the shower was also very good and all of the boat was spotless and the host was awesome."
31,216858619,12/6/2017,Lloyd,"Really special accommodation, although any more than two people and it will feel cramped. Also worth noting that there are no kitchen facilities. The novelty of being on a boat and the quality of the finish make it a great option though."
31,217655693,12/10/2017,Thomas,It was amazing place to have a spezial and authentic stay in this beautiful city. The host we met was mark he is very friandly and easy guy to talk with.  he evan helped us wehn ouer flight was cencellt. Tha boat is just perfeckt located and very clean. <br/>We would like to stay here again. <br/>Thank you and jus the best
31,223475346,1/1/2018,Yohann,"PremiÃ¨re expÃ©rience sur un bateau, atypique et trÃ¨s sympa. Ce logement manque cependant d'intimitÃ© pour 2 couples. PrÃ©fÃ©rer un couple avec 2 enfants max. PropretÃ© et Ã©quipements parfaits."
31,235908820,2/18/2018,Tatiana,"Our experience in the houseboat has been amazing (very clean, with nice details, comfortable...)!! Mark has been great! Thank you Mark for your help and kindness. I wil recommend for sure this place."
31,242571963,3/12/2018,Anita,"Fantastisches Boot, super Lage und exzellente Gastgeber!!! Sofort wieder"
31,246751469,3/26/2018,Phillip,"Olaf and Mark are lovely to be hosted by. The boat is near enough to town to easily walk, and still be tucked away, distant from the tourist noise."
31,247316664,3/28/2018,Kai,"A wonderful, cosy and speacial place to spend some days in Amsterdam! The house boat is nothing less than perfect for a couple or a small family. I have been on the boat with my son aged 11 and we loved this place from the first second. It is close to the spots in the centre, but nevertheless private and quiet. Very smart and appealing interior. Mark is a very reliable, friendly, relaxed and helpful person, definitely a great host! Thanks, Mark! We hope to come back soon."
31,252125156,4/9/2018,Victoria,"We enjoyed our stay at the lovely houseboat Johanna! Mark greeted us upon arrival and showed us around. He gave us nice tips and also offered further help during our stay. The boat was very clean and we had everything we needed. Yes, the rooms and beds might be a bit small but not smaller than expected and just right for the ""real houseboat experience"". We loved it and do absolutely recommend to stay at Johanna! Thank you!"
31,253334119,4/14/2018,Matthew,"One of the best ways to experience Amsterdam! Living on a boat definitely takes some getting used to -- but for us it was well worth it! Houseboat Johanna played an important role in making our trip so memorable. Great location with bars, restaurants, shopping, cultural sites and grocery store a short walk away. Mark was very responsive and timely in his correspondences, and he provided an excellent overview of the houseboat itself and the surrounding area upon arrival. He also made himself accessible to us throughout our stay without being intrusive at all. Highly recommend this houseboat for anyone looking to experience a different side of Amsterdam!"
31,255343390,4/20/2018,Dino,"The houseboat Johanna was a great adventure on a canal close to everything...well appointed, charming and extremely comfortable! Marc and Olaf were great hosts- easy to communicate with and very accommodating for our early morning arrival! Sitting out on the bench atop the boat and enjoying the evening air was a great way to relax!"
31,257169883,4/25/2018,Taralyn,"Staying at Houseboat Johanna was truly amazing. First nothing screams a true Amsterdam experience quite like staying in a houseboat! But Mark and OlafâÄôs houseboat is BEAUTIFUL! The decor is stylish, warm and inviting. <br/><br/>They are located on a quiet canal but very very close to all the hustle of the Amstel River. They are a stones throw away from a tram and metro which makes for easy access in and out of the Amsterdam Centraal. Mark was amazing and so helpful from booking to checking out and even had local tips for us. <br/><br/>I was truly sad to leave and cannot wait to go back and stay at this beautiful houseboat again!"
31,257736122,4/27/2018,Derrek,"It is a really great little Airbnb.  A quick walk from most any of the amazing parts of Amsterdam.  Clean, Quiet and a great room to have a morning coffee right up in the Pilot house.  You can't go wrong here..   But do be aware that because its a boat, the ceilings can be low.  So if that is a concern, do consider that.  Otherwise we loved everything about our time in Amsterdam and aboard the Johanna."
31,259688215,5/1/2018,Sheryl,"Truly a lovely space and I appreciate the craftsmanship that went into creating this space. Communication was easy. One thing I would warn you of, is if you are traveling by your own car, make sure to take anything of value out of it. We got distracted taking our stuff out and someone left a backpack in the car and someone broke in to get it. But thatâÄôs on us, not the lovely neighborhood the houseboat is in and out hosts were most empathetic. Would come back and stay here again in a heartbeat!"
31,269245771,5/27/2018,Sonja,"What a truly wonderful space! Great location, unexpectedly spacious and beautifully finished. We were traveling with 2 young children and the cupboard bed was such a fantastic hideaway cubby for them, they will be talking about it for months! We loved relaxing with a coffee in the morning or a glass of wine in the wheelhouse, watching the girls play and watching Amsterdam wander by. Mark is very friendly and had lots of great suggestions for kid friendly outings but generally left us to do our own thing. A really great experience, thank you!"
31,270708586,5/30/2018,Marie,Such a wonderful experience. The boat was beautiful and we loved watching boats pass by from the head house. ItâÄôs beautifully kept and Mark was very nice! Highly recommend! 
31,274499695,6/9/2018,Ian,amazing space so close to the center.
31,276957801,6/15/2018,Kathy,The boat is amazing and beautifully equipped. There is a room up top which is the old wheel house and I could have sat there all day and watched the boats go by. Great location too. We fell in love with the Bakhaus at the top of the road and Bagels and Beans along the canal. You can walk to most things but also close to metro and tram stops.
31,279313612,6/20/2018,Cara,"This is a truly unique experience on one of the centrally located smaller canals. The space is clean, newly renovated and has just what you need. Our 2 young boys (7,9) slept in the cupboard bed for with no problems for 5 nights. They loved watching the boats go by and feeding the ducks off the side of the boat. Mark is a great host too. HeâÄôs responsive and helpful when you need him. "
31,280364722,6/23/2018,Mary,Fantastic location!
31,282016505,6/26/2018,C,Gorgeous and convenient house boat! We had a wonderful and memorable stay! Thanks so much!
31,283212186,6/29/2018,Jeff,"This cute houseboat exceeded all our expectations. Olaf and Mark take great pride in their property and it showed throughout. Additionally, they went out of their way to provide local tips and even arranged a cab for our return. They were always available but never in the way. The location works well. It is not in the middle of everything, lending to a quieter environment. Yet, we were not too far away. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to our friends."
31,284355519,7/1/2018,Lisa,"For an authentic Amsterdam experience, look no further than this Airbnb. Centrally located and surprisingly quiet. Drinking coffee in the morning and enjoying the view in the canal was fabulous. Mark and Olaf were very helpful and hospitable. I want to go back!!"
31,285207255,7/3/2018,Theresa,"Great location. Close to all of the great city sights.  We had a great time feeling the culture of the city by staying right on the canal. Mark and Olaf were great hosts.  The boat was clean, stylish and so fun to be a part of."
31,286788724,7/7/2018,Toby,"This is the perfect place to stay. Quiet and so very charming. Mark was a gracious, hospitable and importantly available host. <br/><br/>We didnâÄôt spend much time on the boat, but it was perfect. <br/><br/>Would definitely recommend!"
31,291666370,7/16/2018,Chelle,This houseboat will give you an experience in Amsterdam like no other. You're right on the canal! Spend your evenings sitting outside watching the boats go by and the birds swimming. Easy walking to food and things to do. This houseboat worked well for us as a couple with our 14 year old son. Don't stay in a boring old hotel. Go for the houseboat!
31,306750287,8/13/2018,Matthew,"We had a great time visiting Mark and OlafâÄôs place in Amsterdam.  It is in a great location in the center of  Amsterdam  very close to Waterlooplein. <br/><br/>Olaf greeted us warmly when we arrived and oriented us around the boat and the area. The boat is very well layed-out, tidy and clean.  The space is bigger than the pictures make it look. The little room was perfect for our son, he loved it!<br/><br/>On another note, our booking was suddenly cancelled when Airbnb  did not accept the second payment.  I was given the run around but Mark contacted them.  After he called Airbnb were great and it was all sorted out.  Mark went over and above.  He truly is a super host!<br/><br/>"
31,312322671,8/23/2018,Mario,
31,317429940,9/2/2018,Barbara,"This was a fantastic experience! The houseboat is beautiful, in a perfect location and Mark couldnâÄôt have been a more gracious host! We loved everything about it - itâÄôs incredibly clean, comfortable, but our favorite thing was sitting on the top having coffee or wine and watching the gorgeous view! The sunsets were spectacular! The location is great and we were able to walk almost everywhere. Definitely the best way to experience Amsterdam...we felt more like locals than visitors. Mark leaves a book with great suggestions for activities and restaurants...we did a few and all were excellent!"
31,322053102,9/12/2018,Jeanine,This is a great place to experience living like a local. Mark and Olaf met us early and gave great tips for finding things nearby. The houseboat is within walking distance of everything. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and highly recommend it.
31,322890959,9/14/2018,Jennifer,"We chose the houseboat to try a unique experience when visiting Amsterdam. It was a great decision to make and we plan in staying here again when we return.  The boat was incredibly clean and comfortable and had everything we could possibly need. Our host was friendly, helpful and accommodating. I loved the 'bunk' that I slept in and I had a better night sleep than I've had in a long time. I didn't want to leave!"
31,324906005,9/18/2018,Charlie,"We had a great stay, location is close to downtown metro etc. Food store and restaurants just around the corner. The boat is equipped with everything you need. Fancy furniture and modern bathroom. No closet for clothes, but this was not an issue for us. Same with the shared kitchen as we did not plan to cook.<br/>One bedroom is a cabin for rather smaller people (kids). I would not recommend it for two couples anyway as you have to walk to the other bedroom to go to the bath. Marc is a friendly host and he was very supportive. As he lives on the boat as well you have immediate help if needed."
31,326865602,9/23/2018,Kristof,"Staying in Johanna was a magical experience. We all fell in love with the canals of Amsterdam staying here. It's a very unique way to experience the city, as you're right on the street. One the most memorable things we did during our stay in the city was just hanging out on the boat with some beers while watching the sunset.<br/><br/>Those who are particularly concerned with privacy might want to think twice though, for two reasons. First, the person staying in the stern bed has to walk through the main bedroom to get to the bathroom/toilet. Second, people can see into the living areas from the street through the portholes in the side of the boat. Neither of these was a big deal for our group, but just something to consider for your own needs."
31,339804757,10/22/2018,Chris,"Had a lovely time on Johanna, Mark and Olaf were great hosts and very quick to reply to any messages. Thoroughly recommend. Thanks for lovely stay."
31,342140174,10/28/2018,Deborah,"Staying on the houseboat was great. It was both cosy and spacious and felt very peaceful. The wheelhouse was a great space to enjoy a drink and a picnic meal. Great location, very close to metro just a few stops from Central Station."
31,343907288,11/2/2018,AndrÃ©,"We had a great stay in Amsterdam. The Houseboat is very clean , cozy and ideally situated to visit this amazing City. Thanks to the hosts who welcomed us very warmly ."
31,344712939,11/4/2018,Gaia,"We visited Amsterdam in the last 2 days of our Europe visit from Brooklyn/NY. We loved Johanna. The experience was great for both me and my husband as well as our kids... it was peaceful, cozy and quiet. Johanna had everything we needed for our short stay there. Since our stay was very short, we never ate in but if we needed, the full-shared kitchen had everything. Our kids collected more memories in 2 days then the rest of our Europe vacation in 2 weeks. The hosts Olaf and Mark were both great. <br/>We had a great time at Johanna!"
31,349758690,11/18/2018,Andreas,"Close to metro, cafÃ©s and urban Amsterdam."
31,354817794,12/2/2018,Helen,Great space with plenty of charm and thoughtful hosts! A very unique property in a perfect location to explore Amsterdam :)
31,361745302,12/24/2018,Kazufumi,"This was my first stay at boathouse and it was beyond my expectation. Olaf And Mark's boathouse gave us wonderful time in Amsterdam and Mark treated us very kindly. When I have a chance to come back to Amsterdam, I would stay at this house again."
31,408389313,2/4/2019,Carmen,"We really enjoyed our stay on Johanna! The boat was much more spacious than we expected & was very comfortable. The space was lovely & check in / out were  easy. Olaf was very welcoming & gave us some great suggestions for our stay. The only thing to be aware of before booking is that there is a ladder/steep steps to get from the living space to the exit. It wasn't an issue for us & we spent the mornings up top with coffee enjoying the view. Great location, too. Just a few minutes walk from the underground & tram stops. It was easy to make our way to  the museums or out for dinner. Highly recommend staying here if you're visiting Amsterdam!"
31,409652395,2/8/2019,Marko,"We really enjoyed our stay and the location was perfect for our needs. The boat was clean and had almost all anemities we needed. I highly suggest Olaf and Mark's Johanna if you want to taste the living in a house boat. Thanks for the exellent service, too!"
31,410513872,2/10/2019,Jen,"A truly wonderful and great experience. We visited the unique house boat during winter and it was warm, cosy and an amazing stay! We didn't get the opportunity to meet Olaf but we met Mark and he was extremely hospitable and friendly. He gave us local tips on where to eat nearby and was quick to respond to all my queries. It is a great location and really near to the city. The house boat was very clean, comfortable and really enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone."
31,413207873,2/17/2019,Huma,"We had a really lovely time on Johanna - such a fab boat in a great spot, what more could we ask for! And Olaf and Mark are truly wonderful, caring hosts with superb attention to detail."
31,422467678,3/11/2019,RenÃ©,"This is a wonderfully romantic place, right in the centre of Amsterdam with everything you need within walking distance. Highly recommended!"
31,427850567,3/24/2019,Lena,"Beautiful place, super clean and well maintained. Looks a bit more spacious on the pictures."
31,430329693,3/30/2019,Katelynn,Great houseboat in an ideal location. My travel partner and i enjoyed chatting with mark and Olaf and would definitely stay again!
10,233582425,2/10/2018,Gamal,"A fantastic host and wonderful studio. Spotless, stylish and in a great location. Very steep stairs, but characteristic of Amsterdam apartments so part of the charm! We really loved De Pijp - so many fantastic bars, restaurants and coffee shops. Also walking distance to museums and the centre. The ideal choice for a few days away, couldnâÄôt recommend more."
10,236022454,2/18/2018,AndrÃ©s,"Patrick and Ilin were great hosts and really deserve 5 stars. We arrived late and still had a nice check-in, with some birthday beers in the fridge (unfortunately didn't spend so much time in the lovely studio to actually enjoy these)<br/>Tips for others staying with P&I or in De Pijp: Check out the Japanese bar/restaurant De Japanner - Albert Cuyptraat 228, just around the corner, Little Collins, and Bar Duvel. There is also a great Ethiopian restaurant called Azmarino."
10,238206278,2/25/2018,Morgane,"Notre sÃ©jour chez Patrick sâÄôest dÃ©roulÃ© Ã  merveille ! Le studio est parfait pour un week-end, le quartier trÃ¨s sympa, avec de nombreux bars et restaurants dans les environs. Patrick est un super hÃ´te ! Je recommande pour un sÃ©jour Ã  Amsterdam."
10,239545542,3/2/2018,Andy,"Amazing studio, very trendy and minimal. Patrick was great and checked us in himself. Decent location, great value. Would definitely stay here again."
10,240249019,3/4/2018,Victoire,"The studio is very comfortable, and perfectly located in a vibrant neighbourhood, with a lot of trendy bars, good restaurants and shops. <br/>Patrick is a very kind and helpful host, always available to make our stay easy and enjoyable. <br/>The perfect place for a cosy city break in Amsterdam."
10,244297810,3/18/2018,Shiori,"Staying at Patrick's has been a perfect choice. Cozy studio fully renewed with style. The neighborhood is just 10min by tram to the hotspots. Lots of cafes, restaurants and cute shops around plus a handy supermarket. Patrick was a great host."
10,247982612,3/30/2018,Lisset,"The studio is very comfortable for two people. It's in a great location, and the hosts are extremely helpful and kind. <br/>The studio is one block away from the Albert Cuyp Market that is a fantastic place where you can found anything from delicious food to clothes and souvenirs.<br/>I recommend staying here. Amazing place!"
10,249463204,4/2/2018,David,"My stay at Patrick's place was amazing! The space is very stylish and clean. It's also located in an amazing area with plenty of places around to eat. One night I got takeout at The Butcher (a burger place) and also ate at Little Collins (a restaurant located right below the studio). The studio is very close to many tram lines, I'd advise to buy the tourist tickets for unlimited use of the tram and also the train between the city and the airport. One thing that I should mention is that the studio is on the second floor and the stairs are very steep. This wasn't a problem for me as an able-bodied 20 year old, but I could see this being a problem for some people with disabilities."
10,250528565,4/5/2018,Chloe,Absolutely beautiful studio flat. The area is fantastic with amazing eateries. Highly recommend!!!
10,250829231,4/6/2018,Silja,"The room was super clean, comfortable and Patrick very friendly and helpful. Location is perfect. Can only recommend to stay here!"
10,252860604,4/12/2018,Liying,"Patrick and Illin were great hosts. They are very welcoming and friendly. When our travel adaptor wasnâÄôt working, they loaned us one. When the TV wasnâÄôt working, Illin quickly resolved it. We didnâÄôt expect the staircase in Amsterdam to be so steep and we turned up with heavy, huge luggages. Patrick and Illin very kindly helped us with them. <br/><br/>The place looked even better than the pictures. It was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Patrick later told us we were one of the first few staying in this new studio, how lucky! It was better than many 4 star hotels we stayed in UK prior to arriving in Amsterdam. <br/><br/>The studio is located in the lovely De Pijp neighbourhood with the Albert Cuyp market just around the corner. The original stroopwaffles here are delicious! We tried the recommended Bazar (middle eastern cuisine) and Omlegg (omelette breakfast) which were good too. Many restaurants here open till late. Really appreciate the neighbourhood and region guides provided in the room. ItâÄôs about a 15mins walk to the museums, 10 mins walk to Heineken Experience and less than 5mins walk to the tram. <br/><br/>This was such an unexpected gem, I would definitely recommend PatrickâÄôs studio!"
10,254227610,4/16/2018,Caroline,"Patrick's apartment suited us very well indeed.  He is an excellent host, responsive and helpful.   The space is light, bright and welcoming with a comfortable bed.  Everything worked!<br/>We enjoyed the local area - Alberto Pozzoti's for good coffee and food and Manama in particular.  A free walking tour with Sergio who runs FreeDam Tours was fun."
10,254814042,4/18/2018,Willy,"Patrick and Illan are really superhost, the studio is super clean with great design, the hosts even recommend places to eat, the location also very nice and easy to get around, definetely gonna stay here again if we visit netherland next time."
10,255625162,4/21/2018,Leora,"We had a wonderful stay at PatrickâÄôs apartment and would totally recommend it. The studio is in a great location. We loved the area - the restaurants, shops, market and park. ItâÄôs also easy and close to the center of the city - we walked everywhere.<br/><br/>The studio itself was lovely-  really light with a very nice bathroom. (The bed is really big and super comfy.)<br/><br/>Patrick was a very welcoming host and really wanted to make our stay as great as possible. He helped us with our suitcases up the (steep) stairs. We had a problem one evening with the lock on the door (it was a one off and is fine now!) and to make up for it, he bought us a bottle of wine and some beers the next day.<br/><br/>In short a great place, location and host!"
10,257225039,4/25/2018,Isobel,"PatrickâÄôs apartment was extremely beautiful, clean and minimalist! The attention to detail made the stay very special , including the local restaurant recommendations and stroopwaffels. This was the first Air Bnb we have stayed in, and if all of them are as simple to arrange and luxurious as this, weâÄôll definitely use the service again. Patrick and his partner also helped us with our bags, and allowed us to pick up our luggage after check-out, allowing us to spend the final day around the local area. Thank you!"
10,259011285,4/30/2018,Julie,"PatrickâÄôs apartment is really nice : clean, well located in the Pijp, walkable to the center (40 minutes) and to the Museum Plein (15 minutes). Nice coffees and restaurants around.<br/>I recommend !"

10,261426876,5/6/2018,Eldon,"Wow! We stay at a lot of Airbnbs and this is one of the best-appointed and most thoughtfully-approached flats weâÄôve ever stayed at through the platform. Think of it like a stylish hotel room ++ since it also has a small kitchen and the location is so central to such a cool neighborhood. Highly recommended, thanks again!"
10,263510193,5/12/2018,Elizabeth,"PatrickâÄôs home is exactly like the picturesâÄîsuper stylish, super clean, and super comfortable. ItâÄôs located in de Pijp which is close to a bunch of trams and near a lot of great restaurants! The only fault was the TVâÄîit was a bit wonky to use, but we didnâÄôt use it much so it wasnâÄôt a big deal."
10,265405351,5/17/2018,Natalie,"I would absolutely recommend this airbnb to anyone looking for a small studio in an upbeat young area. We travelled with a larger group who all had different accommodations some stayed at a hotel in a busier tourist area and they did not have as great of an experience as we did! PatrickâÄôs Airbnb was absolutely perfect for us. Great upbeat area, amazingly clean, super comfy bed and very quiet in the studio. Patrick was super responsive and very friendly.<br/><br/>The only thing that is a watch out would be the extremely narrow stairs, wasnâÄôt a concern for my husband and I but for someone who is older or has physical limitations this would not be the place for you. I would highly recommend this awesome studio in a lively fun area!!!"
10,266551550,5/20/2018,Kevin,"The apartment location was perfect for our trip requirements.  It is within walking distance of many attractions. Easy access to restaurants, grocery stores, and trams. Patrick was a great host!!"

10,272875047,6/4/2018,Karolina,"Perfect studio in the very hip area of De Pijb. Close to many great restaurants and bars. The studio was very clean and provided my boyfriend and I with everything we needed. <br/><br/>The communication was very easy and really appreciated the clear instructions on how to get to the studio and the helpful tips on restaurants, museums and fun things to do in the area. <br/><br/>Very much enjoyed our first time in Holland and thank Patrick and IIin for being so friendly and welcoming us with stroop waffles! Recommend highly and would visit again."
10,273434234,6/6/2018,Sherry,"Excellent location, next to restaurants and shopping, and a park. Patrick's place was very clean and has everything you need for a night stay. It's very quiet. The communication was great and check in was clear. Thank you!"

10,276202765,6/13/2018,Olivia,"Loved staying at PatrickâÄôs, super clean and stylish. What we loved the most was the location. Out of the main touristy hub with fantastic cafes and restaurants. Easy public transport but also central enough to walk most places. "

10,279280430,6/20/2018,Jordan,"Excellent hosts!! Patrick and Llin were so accommodating, they provided tons of local tips for sight seeing, tours, restos and bars, all of which pulled through as real treats. Communication was excellent, touching base everyday to see if there was anything we needed. The flat was gorgeous, spacious, shower is unbelievable, bed was very comfortable, everything was sparkling clean. <br/><br/>I canâÄôt say enough about this place. ItâÄôs located rite in De Pijp, so lots of restaurants, pubs, coffee shops and bike rentals (which you must do! Best and cheapest way to travel Amsterdam!) very close walk to the tram as well. <br/><br/>There is no place I will stay besides here if we ever return, the entire experience was fantastic! Highly Recommended!!"
10,279979566,6/22/2018,Jenny,Had a fantastic stay! De Pijp is a wonderful area and the apartment is ideally located. Patrick's handbook came in useful when we were choosing places to go for dinner. He was friendly and very helpful!
10,285653918,7/4/2018,Iris,"Highly recommend! The studio is more beautiful than my expectations. Patrick is a great host and help us move our heavy luggage upstairs. In his studio,you donâÄôt need to share bathroom and toilet with others. The small kitchen with microwave and refrigerator are also available in private, not shared. ItâÄôs easy for us to have breakfast at home. The AH super market is nearby and itâÄôs very convenient to get the food , drinks,and fruits! Sometimes you can get special price! Patrick is helpful and reply our questions promptly.

10,289412446,7/12/2018,Grant,"I wish I could give six stars...this place was truly amazing. Clean and pristine, spacious single room with modern bathroom. And the location was incredible - just outside the canals in a quiet neighborhood near a daily market (Albert Cuyp) and a lovely park (Sarphatipark), but a 10 minute bike ride from city center and attractions. Perfect for couples who want to be near the action but also have a quiet private place to return to at night.<br/><br/>Our daily trip included a walk westward through Albert Cuyp market (operates every day except Sunday)...thereâÄôs a ton of little cafes and restaurants, or the food in the market stalls. One long block away is a row of restaurants - Helst is a must visit for those who love beer (over 30 on tap) - right next door is Katsu, a great âÄúcoffee shopâÄù if thatâÄôs your thing.<br/><br/>Highly recommended to rent bikes - we went with âÄúI Am BikeâÄù 2 blocks away on the market street. Best âÇ¬10 per day we spent. Museum square, canals and attractions are an easy bike ride away.<br/><br/>Just note there are 2 floors of steep stairs to get to the studio...but very manageable (even for my partner who broke his foot prior to arrival and was able to hobble up and down on a crutch)"
10,292921095,7/19/2018,Giorgio,"Great host, very clean room, excellent bathroom. Lots of light, very well furnished and comfortable. And the location cannot be any better!"
10,294403631,7/22/2018,Tanya,"Amazing location, so easy to get anywhere you need. On the prettiest little street full of cute restaurants and cafe's, with a real local feel rather than anything touristy. The bed is HUGE! You won't be disappointed! The place is sparkling clean and has all the things you could need, such as an iron and hair dryer (essentials when going to a wedding as we were). Really great supermarket at the end of the street if you wanted to pick up snacks. The fastest Air B'n'B communication ever, and Patrick is full of tips and advice. Had a delicious breakfast at 'Bakers and Roasters' which is close by, you will have to wait a while but TOTALLY worth it. Little Collins (downstairs from apartment) is cute for brunch too. The room is a totally private studio you can lock, so it feels as if you are actually renting an apartment. Located at the back, the apartment is super quiet. We loved our stay! "

22,451673431,5/12/2019,FranÃ§ois,"LaurensâÄôs flat is in super location for enjoying Amsterdam and hanging out in De Pijp neighbourhood at night. ItâÄôs also very easy to get there from Centraal Station (only 15 minutes by tramway, line 4). <br/>We were welcomed by Steven, the LaurensâÄôs brother. The communication with him was very easy and he was helpful and thoughtful all our stay long. <br/>The flat is plenty of natural light as it is on the top floor (you should have strong legs to climb the very vertical stair!).  It is also a very comfortable place (note that kitchen is a bit simple to cook your own hot meal). By the way, the flat is perfectly in line with pictures and description.<br/>I highly recommend !"

22,516302465,8/24/2019,Blake,"What a perfect place to stay during a trip to Amsterdam! Laurens met us after our flight rather late and was so gracious in welcoming us. We loved all the suggestions he gave for good places to eat, drink, and shop in the area! The space itself was gorgeous, well decorated, and with very comfortable beds. Was great to wake up in the morning and have a coffee on the balcony before making the short walk into the central portion of Amsterdam. It was well located next to a lovely park and great public transport but we walked everywhere from this place and loved it. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to explore Amsterdam!"
22,519804094,8/29/2019,Sarah,"Nous avons sÃ©journer pour 4 nuits chez LaurenâÄôs avec qui la communication a toujours Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s facile. Nous Ã©tions 5, un couple avec 3 enfants dont un bÃ©bÃ©, et lâÄôappartement Ã©tait trÃ¨s bien pour nous. MalgrÃ© la complication des escaliers (4 eme Ã©tage sans ascenseur avec des escaliers trÃ¨s raides comme partout a Amsterdam) Laurens et sa famille ont Ã©tÃ© dâÄôune tres grande aide et trÃ¨s serviables pour monter nos valises. LâÄôappartement est just en face du tram qui amÃ¨ne directement dans le centre. Tout Ã©tait trÃ¨s propre et nous avons beaucoup apprÃ©ciÃ© les attentions de Laurens Ã  notre arrivÃ©e (bouteille de vin, bouquet de fleurs, nÃ©cessaire pour le cafÃ©, gaufre...). LâÄôacces Ã  la terrasse oÃ? nous prenions nos petits dÃ©jeuners, a rendu notre sÃ©jour encore plus agrÃ©able. Merci pour ce beau sÃ©jour !"

22,575489405,12/10/2019,Sandro,"The apartment is roomy, with lots of natural light. It's in a nice neighborhood, near the city center. The only problem that should be made public is that the apartment is on the 3rd floor, and the stairs are incredibly steep and the steps are way too short. Elderly people or persons with even a slight disability would have a hard time coming in or going out."

Thank you Marie for making our stay so pleasant."

It was spotless clean and had everything one could wish for. <br/>We explored everything by foot and were extremely happy with the location of the apartment, quiet but still pretty central. <br/>ThereâÄôs a cafÃ©/bar in the same street, a parc at the end of it and a supermarket 5 min by foot. <br/>10/10 would recommend and iâÄòd definitely stay there again!"
11,258437155,4/29/2018,Dora,"Place was nice for that price. Room would be better if the sunlight could come in in the morning and the bathroom is a little bit minimum design, but othervise everything was fine."
11,269365290,5/27/2018,Bethany,"Eline is a nice host, and the place is in a good location - 30 minute tram from the centre. The room was large, and the bed was comfy. I think there should be some more pictures of the room and other facilities (such as the toilet/shower), so that people know what to expect. Our only issue with the bedroom was that the window does not open, so it was really hot and humid in there. There is also no natural light in the room."

46,504653212,8/8/2019,Andrew,"PieterâÄôs place is fabulous - bright and new, clean, spacious, airy, lovely first floor outlook. One of the few places where the real thing is better than the on line photos (even though the photos are enticing). The flat comes with everything you need, including washing machine and dryer, modern kitchen, TV with Netflix. <br/><br/>ItâÄôs in a great location, 3 mins from Newmarket Metro, and 10 mins from the Central station - easy public transport access from the Airport. <br/><br/>Although itâÄôs just a couple of blocks from the centre of the city, itâÄôs in a quieter, cleaner part of Amsterdam. <br/><br/>Entry is by key, which the host gives you on arrival. We didnâÄôt get to meet Pieter, but his Mum let us in and she was just lovely. The communication beforehand was excellent and we had no trouble finding the place or getting in. <br/><br/>We spent a very pleasant 4 days here and this would definitely be our âÄúgo toâÄù spot if we to come back to Amsterdam."

DoesnâÄôt look amazing from the outside, but really nice inside and all we needed. Close to the Muiderpoort train station but it wasnâÄôt too noisy. We were concerned it might be a bit far out but it wasnâÄôt actually and we got the tram to most places, using Citymapper to help us get around which was so useful. Check in was easy, I just picked up the keys from a nearby safe in a cafe. Mels was very kind at recommending places for us to eat also! Would highly recommend."

I chose MelsâÄô place as it looked like it had a really relaxing energy and it lived upto exactly that when we arrived. The whole apartment is beautifully furnished and itâÄôs very apparent Mels has an amazing creative eye. The apartment radiates this and we felt really at home there which is exactly what you want when youâÄôre away exploring a new place and need a base for your trip. Mels was kind enough to leave a guide book and treats for our trip which was extremely thoughtful. He was a great host and super helpful when I needed it responding quickly.

2,501958941,8/4/2019,Samir,A very stylish apartment with good access to central Amsterdam. Had a nice balcony which is very handy for smokers like myself ;).
2,508073659,8/12/2019,Leanne,"Good location, not to far from central Amsterdam!we walked there each day"
3,310212429,8/19/2018,Chris,Great place to stay. I got a few renovation ideas for my own home.
3,487507880,7/14/2019,Nicole,"When we first stumbled upon this flat on AirBnB, it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. Jurney is the most thoughtful, gracious host.<br/><br/>They provided us with all the information we needed and showed us around. The flat is just perfect! Kitchen is compact and contains everything one needs.<br/><br/>The bed is comfortable, bathroom and terrace are excellent. Location is incredible."
3,492204171,7/21/2019,Robert,"Stylish, comfortable, real Amsterdam apartment in a great location.  Especialy love the view of the trees and gardens to the rear."
3,496192573,7/27/2019,Marina,What a wonderful house and amazing host. Jurney was so helpful and quick at coming back to me. I would HIGHLY recommend you to stay here.
3,502976581,8/5/2019,Abbeygale,"Very lovely apartment, good location with great tram links. Would recommend "
3,512131531,8/18/2019,Delali,Jurney was a great host. The apartment was very clean and stylish. No complaints at all.
3,521602456,9/1/2019,Jade,Great place to stay. Bathroom and kitchen are incredible. Bedrooms could do with a side lamp.
3,525717652,9/8/2019,Kelvin,"We had a great stay, and we appreciated the great communication from Jurney. The bathroom was excellent! Overall I could not give 5 stars, because there was some refurbishment needed which was not shown in the pictures. I would still recommend to stay,  just followup for photos on this as may impact whether you feel the price is good value."
3,529694563,9/15/2019,Rebecca,"Fabulous two night stay at Jurney's apartment. So stylish and spacious - particularly the kitchen and bathroom, beds really comfortable.  Well located on a number of tram routes, less than 15 minutes from Centraal Station. Jurney left thoughtful tips about places to eat nearby - fab breakfast at Local Hero, less than five minutes walk from the apartment. Would love to stay at the apartment again, next time I'm in Amsterdam."
3,551273806,10/20/2019,Catherine,Beautiful apartment! Super helpful host. Perfect place to stay while exploring Amsterdam for the weekend
3,558590007,11/3/2019,Giangi,"Journey Ã¨ molto simpatica e disponibile, la sua casa Ã¨ molto bella e curata. I dettagli dellâÄôarredo sono ricercati. La gestione delle luci Ã¨ molto bella. La vasca da bagno Ã¨ stupenda. La posizione dellâÄôappartamento Ã¨ piuttosto comoda. Ben servita dai mezzi pubblici e sufficientemente centrale da potersi muovere anche a piedi."
3,568402142,11/24/2019,Liam,"Beautiful apartment, very friendly host and great tips about the local area. Would highly recommend and would definitely stay if visiting again."
3,606491125,2/16/2020,Emily,"This is totally worth it! Not terrible distance from center city, and extremely nice."
3,610761530,2/25/2020,Joe,"This is a great apartment and very comfortable. At night, the apartment is quiet and itâÄôs easy to sleep. The location is close to the trams and about a 20 minute ride from the main district of the city. <br/><br/>Jurney is a great host. She wasnâÄôt in town when we arrived but communication was great and she was very responsive when we had questions. <br/><br/>Overall weâÄôd stay here again when we come back to Amsterdam."
16,333397515,10/7/2018,Alba,"Erik's house is... really nice!!! Just in the city center, you can go walking anywhere. It's style and big. 100% recomendable!"
16,337377251,10/16/2018,Gianluca,"sehr gut gelegen, wie beschrieben"
16,339919032,10/22/2018,Anna,"Very nice apartment in one of our favorite neighborhoods in Amsterdam. Erik was really nice, friendly and easy to communicate with. Even though we arrive quite late, he was the perfect host!"
16,342697126,10/29/2018,Evie,"Erik is a superb host! He came to meet us with umbrellas in the rain to make sure we were ok. The photos donâÄôt do his apartment justice, itâÄôs much more spacious than it looks. The location is fantastic, itâÄôs really well and closely connected by public transport although we just walked as itâÄôs so central! We really enjoyed ErikâÄôs sense of humour and great local tips for activities. Would absolutely recommend staying here!"
16,349833466,11/18/2018,Veysel,"Eric is very friendly, helped me with advices, check in and check out. His apartment is very cosy, comfortable and beautiful, great location also with nice garden. There is better than photos. I recommend!"
16,357425387,12/10/2018,AndrÃ©,"Entering Erik's place was like Harry Potter entering his tent. Much bigger and comfortable inside that was expected with all the attentions (wine, maps, soaps, etc...). Very quiet and a big glass veranda giving to a private garden. We will come back for sure. Thank you Eric for your warm welcome and attentions."
16,441635559,4/22/2019,Gemma,"Erik's place is great, particularly if you don't like generic hotel rooms.  It's in a wonderfully quiet area but still within walking distance of most things in the centre. Erik was more than helpful during our short stay. Would definitely recommend."
16,444770239,4/28/2019,Claudio Carlo,"Erik Ã¨ disponibile,gentile e puntuale nelle risposte.Abbiamo voluto anticipare il check-out di unâÄôora ed Ã¨ stato disponibilissimo! Casa particolare e suggestiva, consigliatissimo."
16,451917353,5/12/2019,Antonio,One of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. ItâÄôs an amazing house and beautiful garden in a great location in Amsterdam. Quite but close to everything you need. Eric is also a great host and makes the experience even better!
16,471392520,6/17/2019,William,"Very nice place with glass ceiling sitting / eating area. Short walk to grocery store, tram and subway. Kitchen has nice gas stove, lots of cooking equipment."
16,479653411,7/1/2019,Reem,"Great location close to the tram station <br/>Very comfortable and cozy appartment <br/>But the most important thing was the host <br/>Erik was amazing super super kind and helpful <br/>We missed our flight and instead of getting Amsterdam at 1:00pm we got there almost at midnight <br/>Erik was in touch with us the entire time and made sure that everything is ok with us, also he waited for us until we got there <br/>We also didnâÄôt get our luggage and the airline company were suppose to send it the day after <br/>They gave us a ridiculous time frame 10am-7pm, we had only 3 days in amsterdam and didnâÄôt want to wait at the appartment until we get the luggage, I asked Erik if he around and if he think that he can get the luggage instead and his answer was YES right away <br/>We really appreciate that and we totally recommend everybody to stay there <br/>Thank you Erik for being an awesome host !!!"
16,530845948,9/16/2019,Jessica,"Erik's place is a magical little den on a surprisingly quiet, yet conveniently and centrally located street. The apartment is the perfect size for two people and is full of intriguing art and positive vibes. There's even a garden to relax in complete with fig and apple trees and two sweetheart cat who occasionally visit from next door. I really felt at home, like I was living in the city for a few days when staying there...almost as if in a novel. It's a weekend I will remember and cherish. Erik is  a lovely host- welcoming, creative, wise and great sense of humor. Don't pass this place or its charm up!"
16,547514335,10/15/2019,Hoon,"Erik's place is simply amazing. It makes you feel like you are on retreat in a countryside while being in the center of a big city. You can find artistic or technical touches in every corner of the house, not to mention the amazing garden with apples and chestnut trees."
16,551403723,10/20/2019,Jarle,Centrel and nice and clean Place
16,568920947,11/25/2019,Sarah,"Erik was a wonderful host. He was a great communicator from the start. Erik flexible with checkin and check out, and was at the apartment to greet us when we arrived. The apartment is very close to public transportation so no dragging luggage for blocks. A short 15-20min walk from the city center and in a nice, safe, and quiet part of town. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and had any amenities you could possibly need. We didnâÄôt cook at all but the full kitchen had anything you could need. Erik was helpful with tips about travel and booking museums in advance. Would absolutely stay here again."
97,609627361,2/23/2020,Samia,The perfect flat and the perfect location in Amsterdam ! I will definitely come back in MarcâÄôs place again.
97,612780188,3/1/2020,Bastien,Very nice place for 2 people. The appartment was super clean and it has everything you need for a pleasant stay.
65,338006311,10/18/2018,Adrian,The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
65,343663011,11/1/2018,Cassius,"Great place, a little cold, however if the heater was working, it'd be 10/10."
65,344231695,11/3/2018,Frances,"Super place in a great location. The apartment is far beyond what we expected for the price and we were thrilled when we saw the location. An easy 10 minute walk to the very centre of the city or 30 seconds round the corner for tram, bus and metro connections. Also a bustling shopping street 30 seconds away with numerous bars, places to eat, local shops, supermarkets and coffee houses... there is also a (quiet) Italian restaurant and bar at the end of the road, so very useful if you want a quiet place to eat or have a few beers in the evening.<br/><br/>Communication with Evert was easy, quick and friendly. He let me know immediately that he would not personally be there but check in would be accommodated by his friend Hamid, who was equally friendly. He picked us up from the airport, gave us tips on where to go (and where to avoid) and was very friendly. I had his mobile number and he assured us we could contact him at any time if we needed anything (at one point I had a query about the key and he replied immediately and was super friendly about it).<br/><br/>The apartment has everything you need for a short stay in the city. The stairs are VERY steep and a bit alarming to a tourist, but this is not against the apartment or Evert, more a note to future visitors that carrying luggage up and down can be a bit daunting as there's no lift (which is noted on the listing). From our viewpoint, however, Hamid insisted on helping with our bags, so another tick in the box for their friendliness! He also made sure our Wifi was connected and that we knew how to work the heating before he left, so we felt everything was covered.<br/><br/>The apartment does not have a kettle or toaster, although we used the stove for coffee/tea and, to be honest, for a short stay this is hardly an issue at all.<br/><br/>The pics/description on the site are accurate.<br/><br/>Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone planning a short visit to Amsterdam. I am genuinely amazed at the price given the location/quality of the apartment. Thank you so much to Evert and Hamid - you made my 30th birthday holiday a wonderful experience!"
65,346119984,11/7/2018,AnaÃ¯s,"Appartement agrÃ©able dans lequel on se sent bien, parfait pour se reposer aprÃ¨s une journÃ©e de visite Ã  Amsterdam! <br/>Les horaires d'arrivÃ©e sont flexibles, ce qui est un gros avantage, pour pouvoir poser ses valises en arrivant.<br/>MÃ©nage bien fait. Je recommande."
65,353016728,11/26/2018,Kate,Great little spot to get away from the noise. Be ready for the dutch style staircase as the apartment is on the top floor. If you come for touristy activities be ready to cross teh Amstel every time.
65,354617464,12/2/2018,Matthew,Great place for a weekend trip. Metro to the city centre only takes 10-15 minutes. Lots of restaurants nearby.
65,357742924,12/11/2018,Joe,Large space with pretty much everything youâÄôd ever need. Perfect quiet location with a pleasant walk into the city centre. Great communication and very very easy check in process!
65,359168836,12/16/2018,Constance,"The apartment was very clean with sheets and towels at disposal. <br/>The communication was very good. <br/>Thanks a lot for everything we had a great stay. <br/>Only thing to declare : careful for people with lots of luggage or back problems, the stairs are quite an expedition which we enjoyed :) <br/>Great stay thanks again"
65,360337093,12/20/2018,Mike,"This place is nestled in a nice quiet neighborhood. ThereâÄôs a park nearby along with a gym and grocery store. Super quick to get to the center of town by public transport, bike or even walking. Place is large with an open concept. Evert is a wonderful host and I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Amsterdam area unless someone has mobility limitations since there are some stairs you need to climb."
65,360896222,12/22/2018,Patricia,It is an amazing place with nice vibes and it is also close to the station!!!
65,361697684,12/24/2018,Yurui,very nice apartment!
65,362758235,12/27/2018,Amy,Cosy little apartment in a lovely area
65,366793322,1/3/2019,Laura,The flat is very nice and the location is closed to the Amsterdam Center with underground. It is a typical from Amsterdam.
65,368165625,1/6/2019,Julie,Lovely place to stay ! I recommand
65,405474685,1/27/2019,Steven,"It's not usual for us to write bad reviews, but our latest experience unfortunately has brought us to write this, which in short was extremely disappointing given the price of the apartment. Once we found the place, in which we were given clear instructions and a fast checkin, we unfortunately found a construction site right within the apartment building on the ground floor! A wooden plank crossed across a construction hole from the front entrance to the stairs, which was both unsafe to use and a struggle with out luggages. Once we checked into the apartment, we found a broken toilet (they informed us that the button was broken but the toilet kept on making leaking noises the whole time and we couldn't sleep, and we literally had to put our hand behind the wall to flush the toilet), the washing machine was full of someone else's laundry, with water leaking out of it - to couple it all off, other laundry was being dried right in the living room! The apartment floor was also sandy, presumably because of the construction site on the ground floor. We then had people smoking downstairs late at night and making noises at 5am. No explanation was given as to how the thermostat was regulated, at which point the apartment was an unbearable 26 degrees inside. Unfortunately we received no feedback from the host on these issues. Not recommended!"
65,416294969,2/24/2019,Anna,great communication and immediately came to help us when we thought we had an issue
39,364802847,12/31/2018,Alejandra,"Buena localizaciÃ?n, habitaciÃ?n muy cÃ?moda y muy buena hospitalidad."
38,444648327,4/28/2019,PaweÅÇ,"Not so crowded area, but still pretty close to city centre. 150 meters walk to great coffeeshop. Apartment was really clean and nicely decorated. Please note there is no TV, but there is a fast WIFI."
38,451216141,5/11/2019,Julie,"We had a lovely time at JosÃ©âÄôs beautiful apartment! The space is very stylish and thoughtfully decorated, and it had everything we needed for our weeklong stay in Amsterdam. The apartment is an easy ~15 minute walk to Amsterdam Centraal train station, which made it a great home base. Plus JosÃ© was helpful and quick to answer our questions, and he provided some great information ahead of time about local attractions, bars, and restaurants we should check out. All in all, we would definitely stay here again if we're back in Amsterdam!"
78,543628348,10/8/2019,David,Good place and location makes it easy to walk to most places in the city. Owner responded very quick to a question we had.
78,561369581,11/9/2019,Caleb,"The space was bigger than I expected. And even though I knew that there was a balcony in the description, I was still surprised because of the charm of the place.<br/><br/>This place is in the heart of the action. There were at least. 2 house parties going on around. I could hear electronic music until midnight. This kind of vibe isnâÄôt for everyone, but it didnâÄôt bother me.<br/><br/>Some other notes about the space:<br/><br/>There were convenient charging locations around the room.<br/><br/>Lighting was decent but may be improved.<br/><br/>Great amenities like a private mini fridge, nestle nespresso machine, and hot water electric kettle."
78,596285133,1/22/2020,Max,Thank you.
78,597733378,1/26/2020,Christoph,"It was a lovely stay, location is very nice. Everything was clean and comfy. Only thing i could say is that it was quite loud because of the thin walls, but except that it was great!"
78,599151407,1/29/2020,Kate,Close to the station and has a lot of late night snacks options. Stylish room with a nice small balcony.
78,599491323,1/30/2020,Mia,"Great location in the heart of it all, first floor apartment and great little balcony!"
78,601738068,2/4/2020,Morgan,"Excellent location, lovely room and a cute balcony looking over an internal courtyard"
78,604643880,2/12/2020,Thomas,Really cool location
78,608575508,2/21/2020,MatthÃ?us,Perfect place to stay in Amsterdam. Definitely we would stay here again!
78,609099417,2/22/2020,Maxime,The apartment is well located and bigger than expected. ItâÄôs clean and perfect for a short stay!<br/><br/>However the checkin wasnâÄôt as smooth as I would have expected. They apply late check-in fees to pay âÄúin cashâÄù  if you arrive after 7pm - this is not advertised in the listing. Plus they ask you to fill a survey on a different website before you checkin with personal information- actually IâÄôm wondering if this follows the Airbnb guidelines. <br/>This made the experience a bit stressful and less smoother than usual. <br/><br/>IâÄôd recommend the company to be more accurate on what you should expect because the place is great otherwise.
78,611561972,2/27/2020,Karthik Srivatsan,Great location. Excellent check in and seamless communication.
78,612924487,3/1/2020,Saffron,"We couldnâÄôt have expected anything better from our stay, the apartment is in a great central location. Really friendly hosts, and it was clean and well presented. <br/>Very impressed and would love to stay again"

78,626498946,5/28/2020,Alessia,"Great experience ! Very central and a nice place to stay for a 3 day Amsterdam trip<br/>Thanks again,  Hsiu Yen"
78,628862989,6/11/2020,Greta,"Nice, small and cosy studio in the heart of Amsterdam, in a super buzzing and lively street with many restaurants and shops. (I love it!). Typical old Amsterdam house. Perfect to just sleep, shower and go have some action! Not suitable for dining in. Comfortable bed. There is Netflix installed on TV. I could sleep very well cause the bedroom is on the back side of the street, not on the noisy one."
78,629851084,6/15/2020,Susana,"Great room direct in the city center. The communication was great, the room as described, very clean and cosy, confortable bed, balcony. We loved the small details, and would recommend it. You have a fridge, coffee machine, enough space for 2, everything as it should be."
78,630350361,6/18/2020,Cyriac,"Vey nice stay in an ultra cosy room in the center of Amsterdam, near from everything."
78,631647669,6/23/2020,Giuseppe Davide,"The room is in the best side of Amsterdam in my opinion and is very beautiful considering the Amsterdam standards. But i have to say that the room was clean just is surface, i founded paper towel behind the curtain and too much dust, the bed was clean i guess. Outside was a disaster, the very nice balcony was super dirty, it looked like never cleaned before, attached trash on all the table, i cleaned that with alcool gel (XD) After all i reccomend it, wasn't bad but KEEP ATTENTION ON CLEAN."
78,632219033,6/26/2020,Sophie,waren super schÃ¶ne Tage!
78,633275295,6/29/2020,Audrey,Stylish space at a great location!

78,634756855,7/5/2020,Manon,"Perfect location in the center of Amsterdam, the room is pretty with a little balcony! TV, air conditioner, fridge, there is everything needed for a weekend in this lovely town !"
78,635680565,7/7/2020,Lina,"ItâÄôs a super sweet apartment in one of the best streets in amsterdam! Great restaurants, sweet shops and sightseeing hotspots- all nearby! The place is perfect for a couple of days in amsterdam: Beautiful interior, Clean and lightful bathroom, netflix on the tv, small balcony and there was even wine and nespresso capsules when we arrived. So sweet! Communication was also perfekt: Quick answers. Totally recommend!"
78,636148873,7/9/2020,Naoki,"Conveniently located on the main street. I can't hear the sound of the streets outside, but I was disappointed that the music from the kebab shop on the lower floor was noisy until around 23:00."
78,637717066,7/13/2020,Julia,"Die Unterkunft war sehr gut. Die Lage ist nicht zu Ã?bertreffen, das Appartement war sehr sauber und die Betreuung durch die Gastgeberin lieÃü keine WÃ?nsche offen."
78,638899229,7/17/2020,Jonas,"SchÃ¶ne, gemÃ?tliche Unterkunft mitten in Amsterdam. Alles zu FuÃü gut erreichbar."
78,641346796,7/23/2020,Wendy,LâÄôappartement Ã©tait vraiment top ! Vraiment trÃ¨s bien situÃ© et trÃ¨s propre. Je recommande vivement !
78,643177141,7/27/2020,Riet,In de stad en toch rustig.
78,646284821,8/3/2020,Diane,Logement tres confortable et trÃ¨s bien placÃ©. NÃ©anmoins beaucoup de bruits causÃ©s par lâÄôanimation du quartier
78,648713358,8/9/2020,Julius,"Perfect Location, beautiful and clean apartment!"
78,650414350,8/13/2020,Jonas,Tolle Unterkunft mit allem was man braucht.
78,652096408,8/16/2020,Laurence,"Great place in a great location, handy little balcony too, wine and coffee supplied on arrival, would definitely stay again"
78,655991110,8/24/2020,Paulina Tina Runsten,There is a bar underneath the room. ItâÄôs quite noisy at night. And thereâÄôs an apartment right across from the balcony. Very friendly though. But would not recommend going out naked ;)<br/>The neighbourhood is very nice with good restaurants. Perfectly located in Amsterdam. Had a very nice stay :D
78,657743863,8/29/2020,Kathleen,"Very comfortable bed. Convenient location - close to the central train station. Unfortunately, if you are a light or early sleeper, you will have difficulty sleeping because the room is located above a business that plays very loud music which pulses through the apartment long past midnight. If you are a night owl this might be a great place for you!"
78,658890224,8/31/2020,Stephan,Was nice
78,660071605,9/4/2020,Marc,"The appartment is very well located, all the essential places are in walking distance! The appartment has enough space and the balcony is nice to chill outside and to smoke, but there's no view bc it faces the inner yard. <br/>The appartment could be cleaner, there was dust in every room and the dishes were dirty when we arrived. Besides that, everyting was good; easy check-in, good communication and nice neighbours. Check out the burger place right under the appartment, they are very nice people and serve good food!"
78,661416796,9/7/2020,Luisa,"Lage war top! 10 min vom Hauptbahnhof entfernt und quasi direkt im Zentrum. <br/>Der Balkon war ein wenig enttÃ?uschend, aber hat seinen Zweck erfÃ?llt. <br/>Ingesamt empfehlenswert!"
78,664307578,9/14/2020,Laura,"Das Apartment hatte eine super Lage, sehr zentral und mit vielen CafÃ©s, Bars und Restaurant  in der StraÃüe. Abends ist noch relativ lange laute Musik zu hÃ¶ren gewesen, also nichts fÃ?r Leute mit einem leichten Schlaf, aber uns hat es nicht gestÃ¶rt. Hat auch meistens gegen spÃ?testens 1 Uhr aufgehÃ¶rt, danach war alles sehr ruhig. <br/>Es war alles im Apartment vorhanden, was man gebraucht hat und grÃ¶Ãütenteils sauber, bis auf ein paar Stellen in der Dusche und ein paar Flecken auf der Ãúberdecke. Das Bett hat jedoch bei 1,80 Breite nur eine groÃüe Decke, was etwas stÃ¶rend ist, wenn man nicht gerade mit seinem Partner dort Ã?bernachtet. <br/>Aber ansonsten gibt es nichts schlechtes Ã?ber das Apartment zu erzÃ?hlen. <br/>Leider trifft das nicht ganz auf den Gastgeber zu. Wir hatten leider direkt am ersten Tag ein Problem mit Toilette  und Dusche, sodass beides nicht benutzt werden konnte. Die Gastgeberin war telefonisch nicht zu erreichen und hat ziemlich lange gebraucht um auf unsere Nachricht zu antworten. <br/>Sie meinte dann, dass wir bis zum nÃ?chsten Tag warten mÃ?ssten und dann selber den Klempner anrufen sollen. Da der angezeigte Klempner jedoch einen 24-Stunden Service hatte, haben wir es trotzdem versucht, da es wie ich finde, nicht geht nachts nicht auf die Toilette gehen zu kÃ¶nnen. <br/>Der Klempner war jedoch Ã?ber mehrere Stunden und viele Anrufe hinweg nicht zu erreichen, sodass wir jemand anderen besorgen mussten. <br/>Alles in allem war das Apartment sehr gut, jedoch sehe ich es nicht als Aufgabe des Gastes Reparaturen anzuweisen."
78,666095759,9/20/2020,Milena,Uns hat die Unterkunft sehr gut gefallen. Es war sehr zentral und dennoch ruhig. Die Ausstattung war super und der KÃ?hlschrank reicht fÃ?r die wichtigen Sachen. Alles war sehr sauber und das Badezimmer sehr modern. <br/>Das Zimmer war ein wenig hellhÃ¶rig aber das hat auch nicht weiter gestÃ¶rt. WÃ?rde ich sofort wieder buchen!

72,446313156,5/1/2019,Stephanie,"I was there for a week, over the King's Day holiday so it was a bit pricier for me but to be honest it was worth it! Just across the canal where the ferry comes every 2 mins or so.<br/>There is so much to do in the basement common room and bar and when you head up to your room you hear nothing of the partying down stairs! I was really impressed!<br/>The staff are lovely and are a combo of locals and travellers so they know their city well and give great advice.....even to my silly questions as a solo traveller who doesn't speak Dutch :D<br/>I was in a 4 person dorm with en-suite which was great! But the bed was quite hard for me.<br/>Would definitely recommend! Likely to stay there again soon!"

72,472721622,6/20/2019,Penny,It was staying at ClinkNOORD! The staff promptly responded to my emails and the rooms are spotlessly clean. The location was super perfect for my needs! I would recommend for any traveler.
72,475448091,6/24/2019,Martina,"Cool place all in all. Small rooms, beds are OK but you are sleeping really close to the person in the next bed. Rooms are very silent tho. The lobby downstairs is a really cool space. I expected to work there but there was always really loud music (and lot's of people in party mood) so it wasn't so comfortable for that. The main downside is that the windows don't open in the whole building so summer days are really hot and the air gets stuffed on the room (can't imagine how it can get in a room for 8!).<br/>The service is good all in all and the location is nice because you're forced to cross the river everyday which is cool (and free)"
72,494504101,7/24/2019,Faye,"Laundry room needs an upgrade. 3 washer and dryers servicing the whole building, in which 1 washer and 2 dryers were out of order. 4 bdr female dorm was clean and quiet."
72,500444393,8/2/2019,Zana,"My trip to Amsterdam was my first time staying in a hostel as well as travelling solo so I was initially a bit nervous beforehand however I am happy to say that I had an absolutely wonderful experience! I felt very safe during my stay here, the location is fantastic and just a 3 minute ferry ride (free!) over to Amsterdam Centraal Station. Check in/out was quick and easy and the staff were super friendly and approachable. This room was a decent size with useful power plugs/usb ports and a reading light above each bed and the beds themselves were also fairly comfortable. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
72,517378036,8/25/2019,Emilio,Very nice
72,528627723,9/13/2019,Paula,Central to Amsterdam.  Safe place to lay your head. Easy to get to.  Could have been cheaper but over all not bad at all.
72,548258863,10/17/2019,Rosa,"Mucho mejor de lo que esperaba, con muy buena ubicaciÃ?n, limpio y tiene un bar que sirve de mucho cuando llegas de un vuelo a media noche agotado"

43,455196693,5/19/2019,Nasr,"Our stay at Chun's place was more than great Although Chun was unavailable to meet us at the time of the check in, he was very responsive online to our Questions . The room is exactly pictured;  clean, comfortable, full equipped and very good located as well. We can highly recommend Chun's Apt."
43,457461481,5/24/2019,Tom,"Chun's place is conveniently located in a nice area of Amsterdam close to a park and on a square with a couple of bars, a cafÃ©, and is a 5 minute walk from plenty of shops, etc.<br/>The apartment itself has a small kitchen with everything you need for a short stay, a large living room area, a corner with a large double bed, and a small bathroom. The place is clean and tastefully decorated so would be a good option for a business traveller or couple visiting the city for a few days and wanting to stay out of the city centre.<br/>I had some issues with collecting the keys (was supposed to collect them from a laundry which turned out to be closed) but Chun replies quickly to messages so we got everything sorted out and I was able to check in within about an hour."
43,459276196,5/27/2019,Scott,"This apartment is a large, clean studio with great windows, and it is not far from the metro or great parts of Amsterdam. The loud bars and music around it can make getting to sleep a challenge, so bring white noise."

76,475524918,6/24/2019,Samantha,"Superb! Beautiful, stylish, very clean and comfy apartment bathed in sunshine, especially on the terrace sofa in the morning. Perfect for couples or families. Neighbourhood is filled with lovely local cafes, independent shops and of course canals to stop for picnics or drinks. Lovely canal side walk or tram to centre parts. Hosts (Reiner and Rosa) are super friendly, trustworthy, very quick at communicating and so helpful. We recommend it very highly!"
76,476928109,6/27/2019,Benedikt,"Very nice apartment in Amsterdam. Big living/dining room and place to sit outside. The furniture is modern, bathroom and kitchen are quite new. Everything you need live was already in the aparment. We really enjoyed our stay.  <br/><br/>The neighbourhood is quiet but there are plenty of stores and possiblities to get something to eat in walking distance. <br/><br/>Public transportation is very close and it only takes about 10 minutes to get to the city centre."

28,485696256,7/11/2019,Brent,"This is a wonderful space in a great location.  Very clean and spacious!  A very nice apartment on the first floor and even has a balcony overlooking the road, which was fun. and lots of large windows for a bright and airy feel.  Even though this is located on a busy street, there were no problems with noise and the bedrooms are at the back of the apartment and are very quiet.  The restaurant on the ground floor was also very mellow and was never a noise problem.  Many restaurants are located within the same block and there are tram stops within two blocks.  The full-size refrigerator (with a freezer!) and washer/dryer were true luxuries.  The separate toilet room also helped our family get through routines more quickly.  The beds were very comfortable and also nice towels and other fittings!  Truly lux compared to other places we have stayed."
28,490714834,7/19/2019,Dongjun,"A perfect location of this property next to a big street market where you can have snacks and breakfast and shopping, 5 mins cycling to Van Gogh Museum and the square.

The location was one of the best. Walking distance or just a short tram ride away from all the major sightseeing and dining attractions.<br/>The apartment is very spacious and fully equipped with whatever one could possibly need to make it a home. Including cereals, cookies, tea coffee etc etc . <br/>Amarah very kindly gave us a late checkout and letâÄôs us even keep our bags until later . <br/>This enhances the experience of our time in Amsterdam tremendously . It was always lovely to come back home and spend our evenings there cooking and relaxing .  A true home away from home . Thanks Amarah"

Others note the bar downstairs but we found this hardly was impactful to peace and quiet inside the apartment."
28,553516932,10/24/2019,Michelle,"Its an amazing apartment, So spacious and luxurious, Every detail was excellent. The location is perfect for getting to and from anywhere you want to go as tram 4 has a stop right across the road. There is also a Supermarket just round the corner for your supplies.

28,561833923,11/10/2019,Aaron,"Stunning apartment with very comfortable bedrooms, a full size tub and shower which feels like a luxury item travelling through Europe. The size and space was above and beyond what I expected and made it much easier for three adult men to co habitate for a weekend. The location is great, literally right next to the Albert Cuypstraat outdoor market, walking distance to a few coffee shops, and a quick and easy stroll across the street to catch the #4 tram to take you up to Rembrandt square or further up the Damrak. Amirah was great in replying to messages almost instantly as well, she was a fantastic host that accommodated our unique check in requirements. Highly recommend 5 stars!"

There is a supermarket just couple of minutes walking distance away.
94,664265523,9/14/2020,Florian,"Reiniers and Kates apartment is perfect for a couple. It's very light and there's more than enough space including a full kitchen,... The apartment is located in a quieter area of the city with lots of small cafÃ©s and restaurants around it. Getting into the city by tram is no problem at all and Vondelpark is just 10 min by foot away. We can fully recommend Reiniers apartment."

75,548305355,10/17/2019,Manuela,"It was a perfect stay, Myrthe was very receptive to every question we had and she gave a lot of recomendations of everything to make our stay PERFECT. The access to Metro was very easy so the location is just perfect for the excellent price."
75,553901790,10/25/2019,Sarah,"A lovely, bright and cheerful space, very convenient for bus and trams. The apartment is very nicely decorated but still cosy and comfortable, and was perfect for 2 adults and 2 children to share. The stairs are a bit daunting - not a place for anyone with mobility issues - but the location was very peaceful and quiet. The neighbourhood has many nice restaurants - with kids in tow we especially liked Mojo on the canal and pastry breakfasts at Kwekkeboom. Oosterpark and the Tropen Museum are just a short walk away."

75,562834294,11/11/2019,Steve,Wonderful small apartment and very clean. The hike to the 3rd floor was a mission but didn't put us off as we were out doing tourist stuff every day.  Very close to the city and a short hop on the tram.
75,563885623,11/14/2019,Paula,"O interior do apartamento esta todo reformado e bem decorado. A limpeza deixou bem a desejar, porÃ©m a anfitriÃ£ nos explicou que terceiriza esse serviÃ§o e nos pediu desculpa. O prÃ©dio tambÃ©m estava em reforma e nÃ£o fomos avisados com antecedÃªncia. Apartamento no quarto andar, sem elevador."
75,565230118,11/17/2019,Hannie,"MyrtheâÄôs place was ideal for our coupleâÄôs week-end. The place was super clean and very nicely decorated. Renting bikes was the best to go to the city center. Ask Myrthe for advice on restaurants, all her recommendations were very good!"
75,567032765,11/21/2019,Oskar,Only problem was that there was no spoons or forks and knifes. The host was a bit slow to reply. Enjoyable stay overall tho

Myrthe was quick to respond to my messages and provided suggestions of places and things to do while in Amsterdam."
75,577970908,12/16/2019,Samantha,MyrtheâÄôs place was a perfect location for travelling into Amsterdam central via the train station (Amsterdam Muiderpoort) which was only a 10 minute walk away (and then 6 mins on the train direct!) <br/>We found our favourite breakfast spot âÄòBagels and BeansâÄô only a few minutes walk away and the area round the apartment is lovely. <br/>The apartment itself is clean and bright with comfy beds and the shower room/bathroom are clean and nice. <br/>It was really easy to get into the apartment with the lockbox and Myrthe was a great host easy to communicate quickly with. <br/>Thanks for a great stay!

75,592515067,1/13/2020,Kevin,Great place for a trip to Amsterdam <br/><br/>The place was perfect for a weekend trip. We stayed for a weekend and the short distance to the centrum made it easy to explore the city by foot/bus or bike. <br/><br/>The check-In & Check-Out process was pretty easy and communicated early. <br/><br/>The host answered every question in due time <br/><br/>The place was clean and had everything you need (even a fridge in one of the bedrooms). As there is no kitchen and as the place is not too big a longer stay could get uncomfortable at some point <br/><br/>All in all I can highly recommend this place
75,595479377,1/20/2020,ç?ä,great
75,598879307,1/28/2020,Gabriele,The place is small but nice and a little outside from the city centre. You can walk about 40 minutes to reach the centre or 10 euro uber. If u are looking for a place only to rest it is ok.
75,605357554,2/14/2020,AuviTran,"the apartment was very clean. close to a central tram&bus lines so access to the center of the city was easy. the neighbourhood is quiet,calm and clean-the perfect place to rest."

Way better than the ones in the tourist area! <br/><br/>Cons: A little further out (but that was a good thing because we got to try more local restaurants).

85,559583359,11/4/2019,Robert,"The apartment was as described. It is very open and the light came through the massive windows on both ends of the apartment.<br/><br/>There two balconies, with the large one great for enjoying a meal outside when the weather permits.<br/><br/>The Sonos sound system is great along with the open kitchen.<br/><br/>However, I donâÄôt recall seeing it in the description, there are a set of very steep flight of stairs to get to the apartment which would not be appropriate for those who have mobility issues.  <br/><br/>if you donâÄôt have issues with mobility then the stairs shouldnâÄôt pose an issue.<br/><br/>A very accommodating and responsive host.<br/><br/>The location was excellent with a bunch of great shops and restaurants close by."

85,607622183,2/18/2020,Katy,"This apartment is located close to the Anne Frank House and the Jordaan neighborhood. The whole area is quite touristy, but still pretty and with a good amount of options within walking distance.  The positives: the place has a great view down onto the canal, the heater works well, everything was clean upon arrival, the kitchen was convenient, and communication with the host was good. While the apartment is generally comfortable, there were also a few downsides for us: the drainage in the bathroom (sink and shower) were really slow, the WiFi and the speakers were unreliable initially (although my techie husband was able to fix the issue), the front door locks were difficult, the upstairs neighbor was fairly loud, and the linens were somewhat threadbare."

At check in Stephany was super kind and showed us the amenities and how to use some âÄútechyâÄù things like turning off the lights remotely - super useful before going to bed! The bed is extremely comfortable and the place has everything - even if you just want a getaway, it is very comfortable and has a garden out back.

The apartment is very modern, well equipped and even includes a dishwasher and washing machine.  Also, the kitchen has all supplies that could be needed. Only the plates and cutlery weren't 100 percent clean on arrival. But everything else in the apartment was really clean and it felt homey. The concierge was super lovely and helpful with any questions we had. The city center is easy to reach either by tram or by bus and what makes this apartment very special for Amsterdam is the free parking that comes with it. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would come back any time."

Everything is within a 10 minute radius. ThereâÄôs a coffee place and restaurant right next door with the supermarket not too far.

Ein etwas abgelegenes Fleckchen, von dem man aber jede gewÃ?nschte Ecke innerhalb einer halben Fahrrad Stunde erreichen kann. Die FahrrÃ?der, die bei unserer Ankunft auch bereits zur VerfÃ?gung standen, waren perfekt fÃ?r lange Fahrradtouren in und um Amsterdam! Die Gastgeberin war sehr zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit. Die Kommunikation verlief durchgehend schnell, problemlos und zuverlÃ?ssig. Wir kommen gerne wieder! :)"
23,665001757,9/17/2020,Maureen,"Mooi, schoon, verzorgd en stijlvol verblijf! Het ontbijt was heerlijk en  goed verzorgd. Mooi en leuke omgeving rondom Amsterdam/Haarlem om op de fiets te verkennen.

23,757487399,5/12/2021,Julien,"Location trÃ¨s sympathique et parfaitement situÃ© si vous Ã©tÃ© en voiture. Il y avait tout le nÃ©cessaire dans la location (gel douche, boissons) et la possibilitÃ© de commander le petit dÃ©jeuner. <br/>Je recommande cette location si vous Ãªtes en voiture (5min jusqu'Ã  une gare puis 2 stations d'Amsterdam Centraal)."
23,758283680,5/15/2021,Nadia,"Wij hebben erg genoten van Rachels B&B.<br/><br/>communicatie verliep erg prettig met een snelle respond. <br/><br/>Het huisje is brandschoon, bed sliep erg comfortabel en er is veel te beleven in de omgeving. <br/><br/>Kortom, zeker het overnachten waard!"
23,759825466,5/18/2021,Pascalle,Wat een fijn verblijf is dit zeg. Wij waren op zoek naar een verblijf in de omgeving van Amsterdam met een centrale ligging en gratis parkeer mogelijkheden. Het is supergoede uitvalbasis om Amsterdamte bezoeken maar ook de nabije omgeving zoals de Zaanse Schans en andere toeristische plekken. Het huisje zelf is van alle gemakken voorzien en brandschoon. Het contact verloopt goed en Rachel reageert supersnel. Ze heeft ook goede tips. Heerlijk verblijf gehad.
23,762489055,5/25/2021,Kim,We hebben enorm genoten van ons verblijf. Het huisje is mooi en heeft een goede sfeer. Rachel is een aardige vrouw en ze stond altijd voor ons klaar!

23,764079412,5/30/2021,Michael,Wat een geweldig huisje!! Wij hebben heerlijk buiten gezeten met een drankje uit de minibar! Heerlijk geslapen (geweldig bed) en de locatie heeft fietsen . We hebben een hele dag gefietst door Amsterdam heen.<br/><br/>We zijn weer helemaal uitgerust naar huis gegaan.
23,767637244,6/7/2021,Rianne,"Heel fijn en net huisje, alles is tiptop verzorgd en schoon. Communicatie met Rachel was fijn en ze reageert snel. Het huis ligt centraal tov Amsterdam en Haarlem, heel leuk om te fietsen!  Een minpuntje is het huisje uitkijkt op een bedrijventerrein."
23,768883435,6/11/2021,Maarten,"When you need to be in the Amsterdam region for business and need a great place to stay, you just found it! Rachel is a great host, the place has all amenities you need and the sunset is stunning. When you want to enjoy a weekend in the Amsterdam region I could imagine you just found your place to stay. Rachel is the example of a host and the central location will give you everything to explore"
23,3.89E+17,6/20/2021,Nico,"Big recommendation! <br/>Near to the water, 10 Minutes by car to the P+R of Amsterdam. <br/>Rachel is a very carefull host and helps you With erything!"
23,3.92E+17,6/25/2021,Maarten,Central location and a true home away from home with all amenities needed to create your own âÄúplaceâÄù
23,3.94E+17,6/27/2021,Margreet,"Rachel was een ontzettend gastvrije en attente host voor haar stijlvolle tiny house, dat een perfecte uitvalsbasis is voor tripjes naar Amsterdam, Haarlem of strandplaatsen. We hebben er genoten van het comfortabele bed, het zitje voor het huis, lekkers uit de minibar en de overvliegende vliegtuigen. Een aanrader!"
23,4.00E+17,7/5/2021,Marie,"Der Aufenthalt in Rachels Apartment war mit Abstand die beste Erfahrung, die wir bisher mit Airbnb gemacht haben. WunderschÃ¶ne liebevolle Einrichtung, klasse Service, perfekte Lage und eine unglaublich liebe Vermieterin. Wir wÃ?rden jederzeit wiederkommen!"
23,4.02E+17,7/8/2021,Manfred,"Alles Super und Friedlich, die FahrrÃ?der reichen fÃ?r die Strecke zum nÃ?chsten Bahnhof und ZurÃ?ck Perfekt aus, Alles in allem ist es sehr SchÃ¶n und Detailliert eingerichtet."
23,4.04E+17,7/11/2021,Joyce,Een fijn verblijf van alle gemakken voorzien. Goede locatie met een fijn bed en douche. De kamer is mooi en efficiÃ«nt  ingericht. De host reageert snel op al je vragen en is zeer attent en gastvrij. We hebben genoten van een zeer prettig verblijf dat een perfecte centrale ligging heeft. Fijn is ook dat er fietsen zijn waar je gebruik kan maken als je niet met de auto naar Haarlem of Amsterdam wilt gaan.
23,4.09E+17,7/18/2021,Nick,"Die Unterkunft ist super, schÃ¶n sauber und mit dem Rad kommt man super nach Amsterdam.<br/>Rachel ist sehr hilfsbereit und sympathisch."
23,4.14E+17,7/24/2021,Dirk,"Das Apartment ist sehr modern eingerichtet und sauber. Die Gastgeberin ist jederzeit ansprechbar und sehr bemÃ?ht WÃ?nsche zu erfÃ?llen oder Probleme zu beseitigen. Was man wissen sollte, aber in der Beschreibung nicht zu erkennen ist. Das Apartment ist ca 25qm groÃü, inklusive der Badzelle mit Dusche. Das Apartment liegt nicht am Wasser. Das Wasser ist ca 80m entfernt und ist vom Apartment nicht zu sehen. Der Blick aus dem Apartment zeigt ein Eingangstor eines FabrikgelÃ?ndes. Der in den Bildern gezeigte Country Side View befindet sich zwei GrundstÃ?cke weiter und ist vom Apartment aus nicht zu sehen. Das Apartment liegt in der Abflugschneise des Flughafens Schiphol. Abends Fliegen innerhalb 30min ca 12 Verkehrsmaschinen unterhalb 1000m Ã?ber das Apartment. Die FahrrÃ?der mÃ?ssen dringend repariert werden und sind Ã?berholungsbedÃ?rftig. Die Gegend ist sehr schÃ¶n und das Zentrum von Amsterdam ist mit dem Rad nach 12km innerhalb 40min erreichbar. Das Apartment ist empfehlenswert, sofern die Lage nicht stÃ¶rt. <br/>The apartment is very modern and clean.  The hostess is always available and tries very hard to fulfill requests or to solve problems.  What you should know, but cannot be seen in the description.  The apartment is about 25 square meters, including the bathroom with shower.  The apartment is not on the water.  The water is about 80m away and cannot be seen from the apartment.  The view from the apartment shows an entrance gate to a factory site.  The Country Side View shown in the pictures is two plots away and cannot be seen from the apartment.  The apartment is located in the departure lane of Schiphol Airport.  In the evening, about 12 traffic machines below 1000m fly over the apartment within 30 minutes.  The bikes urgently need to be repaired and overhauled.  The area is very beautiful and the center of Amsterdam can be reached within 40 minutes by bike after 12 km.  The apartment is recommended as long as the location doesn't bother you."
23,4.16E+17,7/27/2021,Tessa,"Wij hebben genoten van onze daagjes Amsterdam en de geweldige en modieuze B&B van Rachel! Alles was tot in de puntjes geregeld en overal is over nagedacht. Lekkere douche, goed bed, fijne zeepjes, mooie accessoires en goede koffie. Een echte aanrader. <br/><br/>Nogmaals bedankt voor je gastvrijheid Rachel!"
23,4.19E+17,7/31/2021,Laura,Het huisje was erg mooi en fijn. Alles was goed geregeld voor ons! <br/>De ligging was prima. Makkelijk een treinstation te bereiken om er lekker op uit te gaan! <br/>We vonden het alleen jammer dat we uitkeken op het industrieterrein waar veel mensen langskwamen gedurende de avond. Verder hebben we het erg naar ons zin gehad!
23,4.21E+17,8/4/2021,Nora,Een fijne communicatie en bij vragen konden wij om hulp vragen waarop snel gereageerd werd. Top!!
26,715146826,12/13/2020,Kristen,"I had a wonderful stay at I's apartment in De Pijp. It is a beautiful place, close to transport, supermarkets and other great stores and sights. I's communication was clear and prompt, and she went out of her way to make my 10-day stay truly comfortable . Great location, strong wifi, excellent facilities (appliances etc.), and it was sparkling clean upon arrival. I highly recommend a stay at this lovely apartment when in Amsterdam."
26,740507101,3/20/2021,Kirill,"I was staying at this place for a month, from Feb to Mar.<br/>Very comfortable apartment in Pijp, large living room with big wooden table, cozy bedroom, nice balcony and a terrace. The kitchen is super convenient, clean, modern and there is everything you would need.<br/><br/>Imme is super helpful, responsive and hospital.<br/>Would recommend this place for sure, I think it will be especially great for couples.<br/>Also, very big advantage of this place is a large grocery store (AH) just across the road."

99,769167508,6/12/2021,Julie,"It was great to have this opportunity to stay at Bell's in beautiful De Pijp on such short notice. Very grateful that it was available. There is good light however the room itself is underground, and I hadn't realised that. There was a bit of a smell as well in the room. It could be a bit cleaner. The bed was clean :) The communication was great, and very easy to check in and out. I wish you the best."

84,3.95E+17,6/28/2021,Denis,"Die Lage ist leicht auÃüerhalb, jedoch wenn man ein GBV Ticket kauft dann erreicht man alle SehenswÃ?rdigkeiten und Orte innerhalb 5-15 min je nachdem ob man die Metro oder die Tramm nimmt. FÃ?r ein Paar oder ein kleine Gruppe aus 3/4 Leuten eine Ideale Unterkunft."
